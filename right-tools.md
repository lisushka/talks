# Finding the right tools for your new job - Transcript

Hello, and welcome to AWS She Builds!  My name is Dawn, and during the day, I'm a - DevOps, DevSecOps, SRE type person.  I like - exploring things, I like automating things, I like making things secure.

But outside of work, I am an occasional author and kitchen alchemist.  And I don't describe myself as a kitchen alchemist because - I like to cook, although I do.  It's partly because I like to experiment in the kitchen.  I like to try new recipes.  I like to try and cook things that people have cooked for me.  And sometimes that turns out really well, and sometimes it's a total disaster.

One thing that I've never been able to master the art of cooking, no matter how much I've tried, is latkes, which are a type of potato pancake that is very common in Israel, and in Jewish communities.  I love them - I cannot cook them to save my life. And this has become - a running joke, between myself and one of my friends, that - I cannot cook latkes.

So, when I went to visit her, over the weekend a couple of weeks ago, and she said to me 'what do you want for dinner?', I said 'well, hey, why don't we give latkes a try, [laughs] so that you can teach me all of the things that I've been doing wrong?  And then- maybe I'll be able to competently cook them.'

So, I get to my friend's place, we go through the day, it comes time to cook, I go into the kitchen to help - you know, we puree the onions, we grate the potatoes, we get out the seasoning.  And then it comes to making matzah meal.  Matzah being a type of cracker, an unleavened cracker that again, is very common in Jewish communities and Jewish culture.  And, in order to make latkes well - as my friend told me - you need to get matzah down to a breadcrumb-like consistency, so that it doesn't go soggy when you cook it in hot oil.

So okay.  We crack the matzah in half, we run them through the food processor, and what we get back is basically just bits of smashed-up cracker.  Way too big to put in, because if we put them straight in - it's just going to go soggy.

So, my friend and I are - standing in the kitchen, talking about this problem, and then my friend's kid comes into the kitchen and points at the mortar and pestle.  And he says 'hey, why don't we give that a try?'  So - we do.  We grab some of it, we stick it in the mortar and pestle, and yeah, it certainly gets it smaller, but it takes a long time to get it down to the consistency - that we need.  So again - back to the drawing board.

And then, my friend is looking around the kitchen, and her eyes happen upon the blender.  Well, the blender's usually used to make smoothies, but - it's good at crushing things, right?  So we take the contents of the food processor, we dump them straight into the blender, we run the blender, and in three minutes, we have perfect matzah meal, the consistency of breadcrumbs, that goes straight into the bowl for the latkes, which turn out to be absolutely delicious.

So why am I telling you a story about cooking latkes in a talk about technology?  Well - it's because it actually illustrates a concept that I - tend to use in my day to day work, and that I want to talk to you about today - which is the concept that there's never a right tool for every single scenario.  There's only a right tool for particular jobs.

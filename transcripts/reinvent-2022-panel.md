# re:Invent 2022 In Review - Transcript

and with that I'm going to hand it over to a lovely panel
thank you
all right thank you iron I'm gonna sit over here a little bit so
I'm not direct line of sight but still can be seen oh I can look that way that's cool
foreign yeah very convenient it's a bit
disconcerting but that's all right well unfortunately we can't see the back
so that's all right all right so thanks everybody um as you know we usually traditionally
run a panel like this after every re invent we do leave ourselves a little bit of a
time to to take it in like we a lot of user groups try to run it the week after reinvent to get in first with their hot
takes and nobody really has time to play with the new stuff to to see that what the sharp edges look like so we used to
leave like to leave it until January um so hopefully everybody's had a bit of
a chance to digest everything over the break and we didn't all forget it while we were on holidays
okay we might be in for a short panel tonight um but we'll see how we go
all right so I'm going to go left to right to start with um can we just introduce yourselves give us a 30 second rundown on your on your
history uh Matthew Gillard I work at cansino as a technical principal uh my passion is
well my career had been data centers and old school tech for many years and I found
the light with AWS and a little bit of azure and my passion is
helping customers not deal with servers so I like serverless
Cloud security that sort of thing so helping train train up people to the new way of
thinking especially developers on those sorts of topics so they're the
sort of topics that I like to look at and also I run Melbourne serverless meet
up with Pete's basket as well so coming up February 9. register now
I'm on the um organizing committee for serverless ANZ which is coming up
two plugs for the price of one hey everyone um boyanjevich I'm a lead consultant at
CMD and I'm a AWS ambassador to say what I'm really passionate about I think it's
the developer experience serverless and to throw in another buzzword kubernetes can't help but just gotta
love what it is [Music] regardless first that's all I'll take
around here but nonetheless um if I had to pick anything that um
really says the passion apart is what AWS keeps improving and changing in the cloud that just makes our lives and
developers lives a lot easier eventually sweet
awesome uh Stephen Senate so I do a little bit of cloud Consulting my background is as I assist admin so a lot
of the fun infrastructure stuff and then eventually I came across this Cloud thing and I realized well that career is not going to be around for much longer
is it so from a lot of other stuff um so I'm also an instructor with a cloud Guru
and also one of our web series hosts with AWS this week I'm in the next episode next week make sure to check it out and also what else do I do and
that's probably the main things hi Dawn you probably know me by a longer
version of that name currently deprecating that for reasons um to be disclosed in a few months
I came to the world of I.T through a very weird long and winding path and
if through going through the world of the cloud and automation eventually kind
of landed on hey most people don't really do this security thing well maybe we could automate some of that
which is most of what I do I also I think generally have a reputation for
vaguely shouting into the void about particular pet services like control
tower and how sometimes the AWS security ecosystem isn't quite where I would like it to be
they seem to be working on some of that so fingers crossed that I have to do like shouting into the void in the near future
all right so did anybody on the panel actually make it to reinvent this year in person
yes how was it um crazy uh busy I think there was
around 60 000 people so it's the same as pretty much 2019 which is the last time
I went um I think last year it might have been 10 or less or so this year there was
just people everywhere and the best part I mean it's the best
part I think of reinvent for me was Community um as an ambassador meeting other
ambassadors and also other Community Builders so people you interact with online seeing
them in person um you know they're all around the world so it's nothing beats that so yeah if
you are involved with AWS Ambassador AWS Greenwich build up anything like that it's your one chance to meet people that
you only ever interact with on slack or on on the line in other formats so
worth it for that alone so they're back to the same level as previous years covered's not a concern
anymore pretty much everywhere that I went I was the only one masked
so and then of course immediately you you get back you start hearing the reports back from all the Australians or
immediately written event was over at all of the Australians get back you start hearing the reports these people have got covered these people have got
covered these people have got covered I think it was about an 80 rate everyone that I spoke to that I hadn't met before
at the Community Builders dinner got covert okay so that's the price of admission for this year I got last year I guess yeah the price is
uh all right so um did either of you wake up and go to the Keynotes live
uh I went to only one only one so there was only one that I could get to because there was a lot of clashes so you've got
to make a lot of priority calls um so I went to Vernors one um which is probably the one to go to
and as an ambassador um we got some reserve seating behind
the heroes so at least that's something he didn't have to queue up with the regular folks yep so normally for those
who haven't never been uh Keynotes are well actually re invent is a queuing an exercise in queues
um but Keynotes especially you have to get there you know it starts at 8 30 you have to get there at I don't know 7 30
probably thereabouts um to get reasonable chance for for a
good spot um but as a you know certain sections of the community get reserved seating so I
think I managed to get in about 10 past eight and pretty much right up the front so that keynote was well worth it cool
Dawn did you manage to make it very deliberately any of them the advice that I got was make sure that you get two
things like the workshops and the chalk talks which aren't recorded so I scheduled my entire re invent
around going to the things which were not going to be recorded and came back with some probably some more interesting insights
than I would have got from the Keynotes I I have them on my list to watch back though yeah that that makes sense to
prioritize what's what you can't see online my experience in the past was always to watch the keynote from bed and
then beat everybody else to the other queues so yeah cool uh boyan and Steven did either of
you get up to watch the Keynotes live I did I assume you're in Melbourne I was
back in Sydney back in Syd one advantage the World Cup was on at the same time so whilst waiting for things I was watching
a world cup yep and otherwise I was watching the Keynotes your screen oh yeah good enough excuse
the next day at work they say look I'm tired because I was watching the Keynotes I'm trying to keep up with blogs the reality was you know we're
recording this right hi guys [Laughter] the reality is
um couldn't miss Werner and couldn't miss Mr slutski either and I think he watched two three two three two well
worth every second cool and just watching that initial bit from Verna if you haven't watched the watch it again
uh he put himself in a matrix it was really interesting and then came out with a giant jacket
okay awareness Keynotes always happen to be the most interesting he put so much effort into it oh he's so amazing
um for me I didn't manage to see it because I was on a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean and I think I was
just dozing off nicely asleep so I think that was a preferable thing to getting up early but at the same time I mean for
me having the recordings was really good they were really timely about getting them up and online and available so my
practice for the day during the time I was on holiday was all right I'm going to set down an hour I'm going to skim
through the keynote or werners I probably spent a little bit more time on because he just has so much stage presence Peter DeSantis too if you
haven't seen his Keynotes they are spectacular and spending a bit of time going through the different blogs that
were available a lot of the takes on social media to kind of keep up to date on that and that actually made it fairly
good to keep up to date on the biggest thing I missed from not going to reinvent is again those social connections spending time with the
people in terms of the information I felt like I was getting quite a good feed just from middle of the ocean
good point with the videos though I think this year they really put in a lot of effort to get the content out to people as quick as possible because the
reality is is on outside of the world it's 2 30 3 30 a.m no one's Really Gonna accept me it's going to be waking up and
watching that I was awake but I can't say I remember much of what happened there we go yeah
except for The Crazy Ones true
it actually wasn't too bad and because now the Fantastic thing with that is because in modern cruise ships you
actually have pretty good internet connections I could actually watch it fairly nicely but again it was a nice excuse to be like I can't take too long
I'll just skip through these what's that new service oh that's interesting scribble that down for later so yeah it
was really interesting probably still better than the NBN that actually is a great segue to our
next question with all of the things that are announced like there's a lot of information to consume across the course
of the re invent week how did you stay informed and pick out what was relevant and important RSS feeds yep yep
actually I didn't I didn't use RSS Foods um
I think I think it was word of mouth so when I was there talking to people it's Word of Mouth what people are excited
about plus also checking the what's new I think those are dedicated what's the block
getting updated throughout the week so I think the RS first feeds for once
as well they kind of started flying through nicely it wasn't just the barrage of here all the new Services
yeah exactly so again a lot of effort they did have two years of time off right
get to practice in yep definitely just watching
watching quite deliberate the way that they've done it in terms of making sure that the information was a reasonably
staggered so that in every break between sessions as I was moving from place to
place I could go through and pick things up I will say it was interesting as well with some of the re invents recently
passed they've done a big dump on the first day and then the remaining days have been like cool what else is new it's like that's all there is where in
this one it's kind of been spaced out across a couple of days and again there were certain themes to the different days and you could start to pick up okay
this is what today's going to be about there's a lot of data analytics stuff today there's a lot of you know there was a couple of days of you know big service discussions when those things
came out so yeah it was very nice the way they paced it yeah we had to wait a bit for the serverless stuff because um
most of that came out on Thursday so you know everyone's almost in party mode and there's still no several synapses too
too many long nights at the casino yeah too many long nights at workshops
also yes true workshops I I did don't think I finished a day
my workshops because nobody else was doing it that's a good time to get in yeah it
talk talks early on in the day workshops in the evening
um for those who don't know chalk talk is basically an AWS expert standing up
in front for the um and talking about a particular service and taking questions and giving best
practices drawing diagrams and it's presumably in chalk or whiteboard yeah
in Virtual whiteboard that's my experience of it yeah so yeah they're definitely the
things to go to because you get lots of interesting ideas they are also the hardest things to get into but you know
this way you go when everybody else is otherwise distracted by shiny Keynotes or Casino tables talk talks in the
morning during the Keynotes section what everyone has been queuing up and then workshops in the evening where nobody bothers to show up and that worked
pretty well for me I I'm not complaining and it's one of those things that the Keynotes you can again watch later a lot
of those sessions that recorded you can watch later you can't get to those talk talks you can't have those conversations with other people you know at a later
time so no no you can't okay good I'm gonna talk to every one of you write down all these notes for next
time this is perfect we are recording just yeah thank you to our gold sponsor
all right so let's start moving on to some of the things that were actually announced
um I'm just going to read Verbatim what the question says it says if I say the most
interesting announcements were only previews do you agree with that and how do you feel about that
I would say possibly not because if I remember correctly and you know if
I'm getting fact checked here we go um snapstart wasn't in preview it was NGA and eventbridge pipes as well so
those were two really interesting ones the interesting thing with these announcements coming out in previews
first is the good thing about them is that there's chance to iterate with them and I mean application composer being an
interesting one where it's pretty good right it's pretty good but there's still a long way for them to go with it and
actually getting a chance for that feedback from the community I hope is going to be a positive thing absolutely and I think that you hit the
nail on the head there that even burner himself came out with the eventbridge pipelines being a big thing and when the
inspiration came from and I won't talk on it too much but yeah absolutely snapstar was by far my most interesting
announcement yeah from a preview from a preview perspective um I think
it's toss up between application composer and BBC lattice because VPC lattice solves a lot of security
problems yeah for sharing Services between accounts especially if you've got airport Enterprises with hundreds of
accounts but the two most fundamental security announcements to my mind which were um inspector for Lambda and
delegated kind of a security announcement AWS bucket in it is a security announcement but delegated
management for AWS organizations were both GA on release so
I I wouldn't say I think the most interesting that's the air conditioner right I
wouldn't say that the most interesting announcements were in preview I would say the ones that people could take and
run with were all ga which I thought was not a bad thing and yeah some of the new
Services being preview or the fundamental Paradigm changes being in preview gives the opportunity to iterate
on things so I thought it made sense what was released as GA it made sense what was
released as preview cool I think that question might have been carried over from our panel last year where we the
2021 re invent had a few more previews than we saw this year um and I think there are a lot of complaints over the
year that they were still in preview six to 12 months later so it sounds like this year we didn't feel it was quite
that bad yeah and I really like Dawn's point there because things like VPC ladders like that's one I'm really
excited about but it is one of those things that is going to require a paradigm shift it's not something completely that's basically that that
came out and I had just built out like I just built out the start of a VP PC if VPC set up for a client and I was
looking at it and going oh no whoever picks that up next is going to have to re-architect the entire thing that I've
done brilliant I just realized something so um thinking about this here does everyone have an idea what VPC lattices
snap start these sorts of things who is familiar with EPC letters
okay awesome that's a good chance for us to talk about though so the same I'll hand over to someone else for a snapstart but I guess did you want to
talk about BBC letters yeah exciting one that's VPC lives just basically up to
this point if you wanted to do cross account basically cross-account VPC the
connections that was an absolute pain required a bunch of fiddling around VPC
lattice allows you to Drew that out of the box so you basically this native
support within a wsvpc for many other things but the one that requires the
paradigm shift is cross-account connections you now have native support for cross account Connections in VPC
everyone has been architecting VPC the entire time that I've worked with AWS to work around that and now you don't have
to anymore and snap start it's huge so to underpin
it at the moment it's for Java only but what it actually does is during the execution point of a typical Lambda
function there's a snapshot actually gets temporarily taken through the firecracker background hypervisor
because let's be honest let's not forget about firecracker here and then instead of having a cold start or a cold
execution of your function at that point in time which correct me if I'm wrong Java tabs the Justin Time compilation
right execution that's when the function actually gets executed and at that point each and every time so you don't have
this cold start issue that you traditionally had when testing we found that from a very small instance which
was a Java issue especially when you're running like 256 Meg went from about two and a half
thousand millisecond to about 200. that's a massive drop and the big thing
is they said for Java for now you can imagine that would go with rust with and
even custom runtimes potentially we could actually see land executions drop significantly and for memory that that
is now just bundled with Lambda if you're using Java that's free yeah yeah doesn't cost you an extra Cent to be
better just move away from java
and Lambda I'm scanning one of the my favorite announcements from 2021
whatever year yep was um inspector V2 because the previous inspector was pretty much a waste of time I didn't do
anything inspector V2 basically is a compliance tool that scans your containers across all your Registries CCR
Registries and uh ec2s for security vulnerabilities and it
came out just in time for a log4j all right so it was very useful yeah and I know a lot of organizations I know I
enabled it for one organization to be able to find out their exposure to that particular thing and the biggest thing
that was missing at that time was scanning Atlanta functions in Lambda code because that's something that
security a very pedantic about and it was again an exposure there was no easy
way to do that other than in your pipelines shifting left your pipeline so once that so I'm pretty sure that's GA
isn't it yes it is yeah Lambda yeah so now you can I can't remember what language is it Sports but it's probably
all the main ones yeah I believe it's all the main ones yeah um and suddenly you can get visibility across your whole organization on
um your you know if you're using out of date packages you know people carrying
things badly that sort of thing if it gets bad actors think about it if someone has access to your API keys and
your secret keys they'll go through and just update the Lambda function they're not going to follow a pipeline they're going to tackle directly
and there's an interesting thing there I mean so did anyone here get caught in the log for J stuff like as soon as the local shell stuff came out who got a
very nasty call at the end of the year around that I think pretty much everyone let's be honest yeah probably a few of us yep and one of the big things from
that was okay so what Solutions do we have that use this thing and everyone sat back and said
I don't know don't think anything so and it was one of those things that you have those you know enormous dependency trees
and you just have no idea what goes so far into them we're having these sorts of solutions like the Lambda for inspect
they are inspector for Lambda it'll look at those dependencies and say hey 10 things up here's this one little thing
that suddenly got a critical vulnerability go fix yeah oh yeah the first talk that I ever did at the AWS
group was about inspector V1 and I went away did the talk on it and then promptly did not use it until V2 came
out because it was useless outside the one very specific use case that I did talk about
which was okay you've had some sort of you've had essentially a compliance
issue and you have to prove to people you don't have compliance problems but
it the release of Inspector V2 was incredibly tightly given log for Jay and
I'm I'm really hoping that the release of inspector for London doesn't end up being quite so Timely
and as you can tell we all have some strong feelings about these things it's a shadow therapy
um so I sounds like we're mostly in agreement that potentially VPC lattice is the most useful thing or the biggest
Gap that was closed this year does anybody have any other things I think there's one that went under the radar you can your Cloud watch logs now have
ml built into it that'll actually pick up three famous letters pii personally
identifiable information one of the hardest things we all had to suffer through and I'm saying all because I'm
not sure I'm assuming one third of us here probably on Optus at one point or another or on another particular medical
provider which I won't name I basically managed to avoid all of them up to this point which has been mildly concerned
well done nah not me though your license but regardless you can now pick that up in your Cloud
watch Vlogs the reality is is that as much as we want um developers to do the right thing we have to find ways to kind
of keep them accountable that also counts for us so at the same time there's the fact that we can get scanned alerted through and then act upon it
without really doing much is great and I think that comes in as well with
the VPC ladder stuff as well is that we're trying to make it easier for developers to do their own thing rather
than saying You must do XYZ instead the administrators the account operators can
put the guard rails in place and say go forth and do your thing within a nice safe you know boundary that we've
created around that same thing for the logs because at some point we will be outputting stuff in logs that is pii and
instead of saying never ever ever put these logs out with pii instead we can say look if it happens we'll still be
able to catch it we've got those guardrails yeah exactly I would say from my point of view the most impactful
announcement that I was actually the delegated Management in
AWS organizations because in large Enterprises historically you have
basically always had the one bottleneck you you have that one account you know
you have the one or Groot account where you have a very very small team of people managing it and there's a lot of
stuff in so being able to start delegating things out
that's really important for because as any of you who've heard me
talk for more than about 10 minutes would know my least favorite thing in the IT industry and everyone else's single points of failure and I really
like that because it very very quickly allows you to start removing single points of failure you can just go cross
them off start delegating things out it then ceases to be a problem that makes me really happy as as someone who has
been on that team and has been the bottleneck multiple times a lot of nods from the panel I think
everybody's experienced being the bottleneck from time to time um so a lot of useful Services Matthew
what's something that maybe not so useful but you look at it and went wow that's really cool
you weren't expecting perhaps oh maybe um the really cool one is uh step functions
distributed map I think um well we've already talked about that so
um Step functions is distributed map basically what that allows you to do is
give the service a whole bunch of say S3 objects and run a function on all of
those objects and you can do millions and millions within a couple of minutes
so there's a there's a good talk on that and there's a lot of a lot of use for it
I haven't personally got a use case for that yet but I can some previous data
projects I've done which I've had to use Pi spark for potentially this would be a
much faster solution you don't have to learn spark you do have to learn step functions
you know probably DSL which having done it recently is not a lot hard but the um
the GUI helps there as well so it's all it's all GUI based um and that's the other thing the step functions are even
over the last year or two the the GUI um you know Builder tools yeah it's a visual editor the visualizer for step
functions is really good yeah um and I I envisage that that plus the app
composer might if they used to combine then that would be helpful at the moment they're separate parts of the
particularly but yeah so we mentioned app composer a couple of times we didn't really go into too much detail somebody
want to just run this run us through a few yeah sure so app composer is similar to I guess if anyone's ever used cloud
formation design or a similar things like that it's similar to that but really tailored around serverless applications the idea is you can put
your resources onto a nice visual canvas so you know here's where I want my API Gateway I want my Lambda functions
coming off that and then you can start building your Sam code behind it your sales application model so you can build
all that behind it and you can also take your existing Sam code and render into app composer so you can actually get a
visual diagram straight off your config which is really useful to Matt's point I think one of the challenges there so far
is that and again I alluded to this earlier it's still in preview and so there are some things that are a little
bit difficult so for example with step functions you can't actually edit the step function and create a step function
within the app composer you still have to deal with the underlying ASL code which if anyone's had to write step
functions just based on the ASL Json then I feel for you I truly do
um so yeah it's one of those things that you know really just tries into that developer experience we want people to
be able to build serverless apps a lot more effectively without needing to say here's a blank thing in notepad go write
some yamlasm Json instead let's build it out visually and we can actually edit it and map out all the dependencies
visually you bring in a quick pop tool by using our composer that's the biggest benefit I took away from it the end of
the day Enterprises will always choose whatever the infrastructure as code as they want but type time frames mean that new services are hard to adopt app
composers like basically use me as a tool to build quick and build easy
now the other good thing about our composer is that it can read in your Sam templates that you already have
developed outside the tool and it can generate the visual for you so I think
it's been deliberately designed with that in mind if you've used um Cloud the cloud formation visual tools in the past
they're not great and I don't think they're much useful for much this is a
whole new paradigm and the results of the acquisition of stackery I believe so that team's been beavering away for
about a year on Cool Tools for developers to use and I think there's a
bright future there for that sort of tooling and I think that's it it's basically stackery Rebrand with AWS so
yeah reinvent 2022 death of infrastructure is code long-lived the GUI builders
Dawn did you have something that was that was that blew your socks off yeah as someone who
has a very rudimentary understanding of machine load of machine learning at best watching sagemaker evolve
at watching sagemaker evolve from when I first started using AWS through all of
the events that I've been you know that I've watched bits of online that I've been exposed to to seeing the stream of
sagemaker announcements this year at re invent and just going I some point I'm going to have to set aside two months
and just play with me because every every single announcement that AWS makes around
sagemaker makes it look more tempting it just keeps getting bigger and bigger if you get back on the last couple years
there was five to ten announcements to I think it was close to 20 stage making changes they were basically full days
Maker Now and it makes sense that's the way the environment and the industry is moving
and if AWS is going to continue to build out and provide better tools and so be it having played with sagemaker Studio
it makes sense it is awesome and it's interesting so and I guess there's a bit
of a you know secret thing here I'm working on a machine learning course on AWS for a Club Euro at the moment and
one of the things that came out of that was the question of why is there an entire chapter on this thing called sagemaker and only like one lesson on
these things called transcribe and translate and everything like that and it's like sagemaker is not one service it is an entire ecosystem now and it
becomes very difficult for people to find their way around when they're first getting into it because you look at it and it's like where do I even get
started sagemaker Studio well what's this sagemaker ground truth this Sage maker Neo and every year they keep
bringing out more that's probably the biggest challenge with sagemaker is that bar to entry is still very very ambiguous
I would transcribe there was some announcements there around um importing of office files and PDFs and you know
smart what is it smart transcribing of that information it basically puts extract in
front of it so instead of needing to write two steps you now just say take the file and do your thing with it okay
um yeah it's definitely interesting watching it over the years there's two all the service announcements that we
run through here at the user group every month they tend to fall either they prefix with ec2 systems manager or their
prefix with Stage maker like 50 of the time something in those two areas so not surprised to see them continuing to grow
to grow that ecosystem when was there anything else that that really blew you away
I wouldn't say blew me away but it's one that we keep forgetting we all love serverless and we all love the implementations but
graviton is getting a lot of love oh yeah we're at 3.5 and that arm
infrastructure is really doing amazing things for first of all for sustainability don't forget that's your
new well architected pillar and secondly for performance for certain workloads
were either exceeding or matching x86 except being well what was it a tenth of the size to actually maintain and the
benefit is that as long as AWS can provide that as long as the environment continues to adopt arm thank you Apple
um we'll see more and more changes apply we don't have to build an x86 we don't have to pay these exorbitant bills
because what was it Lambda you can now execute and gravitone as well yep one of the talk talks that I went to at re
invent was about a company's process of moving everything onto graviton and it
was over I'd have to go back and check the slides from remember it was over 50 cost
savings moving moving everything with doing nothing else doing nothing else
they had to re-architect a few things which were not supported by arm I seem
to remember that one of them was around something to do with Upstream Java to something it was something to do with
Upstream something I would have to go back and look at my notes but there were some things which had to be merged in
Upstream to make it happen but once they did it it was about 50 cost savings if you're using any kind of compiled
languages It's Tricky but any of the interpreted languages so if you're using JavaScript python anything like that very straightforward one of the
interesting things that came out of the Melbourne region launch actually was the fact that you can't actually launch arm-based Lambda functions yet in the
Melbourne region which is a very interesting quirk as well as with the Sydney uh third AZ
launch give it a month or two for the kit to match the support and we'll get there and with graviton remember that um
before it was launched AWS were eating their own dog food there and they'd pretty much moved all their load
balances over to graviton prior to launch as well so they were also enjoying the cost savings but still
charging you the same that's probably still challenging yeah
it's tough out there especially when you're a multi-billion dollar Corporation but yeah
um all right so of the stuff that we've talked about so far or maybe something new um what are your favorites that are
actually available in Sydney or in or in Melbourne uh I could get fact checked here
eventbridge pipes okay I think that's I I haven't checked if it's available but I'm pretty sure it
is um so eventbridge pipes is about uh if you've ever built anything
stitching Services together um with Lambda you know events Lambda do
something do something else uh event Bridge pipes takes the Unix concept of piping between commands and doing
something filtering or whatever or enriching without actually having to use a Lambda function for that so um I think
eventbridge pipes is a good one staying with Lambda snap start okay I've
had many conversations with many a client where I've said you didn't want serverless before because you thought it
was slow because the cold starts what about now and having run through a few pox man change the only thing we have
left to do now is move on to something else what they said I mean the other thing
would have to be the step functions distributed map and again if you're dealing with any of those things where you have literally tens of thousands of
files that you need to get through in parallel very very useful but I guess the interesting thing there is that step
functions distributed map can run more functions than your Lambda account will typically allow by default you have to
request service limits with Lambda to be able to even utilize this thing to its full extent which kind of says how crazy
powerful it is I have a confession to make here which is that whilst I have played around with
a few of these things I have deliberately configured all of my AWS set up in error to specifically avoid
things not having been released in Sydney so I couldn't tell you what's been released
it sounds like we've maybe this year or I guess it's last year but
there's less things that have gone just to the us or just to two regions perhaps maybe they went globally it was
historically um the the U.S regions and basically error
was one of the regions that historically got things very quickly so when I was setting everything up in my development
account when I was setting up SSO as it used to be when I was setting
up all of the governance systems I did it in a region where I knew things were going to be released quickly so for the
purposes of playing with things I have no idea what's been released where I just know it usually hits the region
that I use very quickly cool we might hopefully be able to do away with our finally in Sydney slide
that we use for the username that would be nice yeah be nice to be on parody blank a couple of times in recent memory
it's gotten a lot better with that sort of thing and they've gotten AWS have gotten a lot better at deploying those Services as well like even when you know
we have some of these new things roll out like snapstar for example the fact that it's available in all regions just
at the drop of a hat I mean it is Lambda it's a core service obviously but all the same it's still a very very new
service and they've just said we can deploy it to all regions we've got it covered that's a really interesting thing
maybe it doesn't need special Hardware so much but maybe we'll replace the final in Sydney
slide with a finally Melbourne slide [Music] that that would be a touch Byron either
yes definitely um it's interesting to think that you
know I've lost track of how many regions there are now but they're better at deploying to all of them than they were when they had 10. 23.
would have sworn it was like 30 or something in Melbourne yeah I think Melbourne is the 24th Melbourne's either
the 23rd or 24th somewhere around there
um all right so Switching gears a little bit um we'll start with you Dawn down that end um what were you looking forward to that
we didn't hear anything about for what you're hoping for I guess
I
around the core AWS governance
governance account management organization Management Services
we got the delegated management for organizations which is obviously a big thing a few changes to control tower I'm
still waiting for a couple more announcements to sort of
join up that governance compliance basic management ecosystem because that for
years has been the one thing that AWS has really not done well and it's
getting there but I did not it's it's it's slow and it's moving a
little slower than I would have liked I would have liked to see a little more on that hey let's get the basics absolutely
right here before we go you know before we go deploying entirely serverless things with Orlando before we go playing
with sagemaker let's make sure that people aren't going to be able to get into the AWS accounts that we've
configured and run up massive bills because you know that always ends well right
Stephen the biggest one for me was honestly the Melbourne region and I was kind of expecting that so I did a I
posted a quick video on LinkedIn yesterday is the whole thing of you know hey you know whatever new AWS Melbourne
region I actually shot that back in November before I left on the cruise because I was pretty sure it was going to launch when we were gone
didn't happen waited through December didn't happen wait through January
maybe it must have been held up for a while and then of course Arjun beat everyone to the post before they even
did the AWS blog and said hey it's up it's like interesting so it came eventually but it did take
some time it was promised two years ago I think or announced two years ago yes it's definitely probably the longest one
that's taken from announcement to release and they did say Q4 but you know I mean massive credit to the team at AWS
to actually you know put something together like that like building a new region with all of the intricacies and challenges and all the architecture for
it is incredibly challenging thing let alone all the hardware but yeah that was something that I was expecting would
come out and then eventually made it interestingly the fact that the Perth local Zone beat Melbourne to the post so
the first time that Perth gets something before Melbourne when
see I love cdk I wanted more infrastructure as code and look don't get me wrong app composer is awesome
right the fact that you can do so much with it and by using so little but we didn't get much love on the
infrastructure as code side so I've probably reassigned all the engineers from that one too more or less but the
biggest one for me would have been uh uh code services so stars in the Wild Card V2 I
think we're well overdue for a co-pipeline version to a code deployed version two and a code build works it's
fine just depends what the container you use but those are the deployment Services have been nice to actually have a more up-to-date version yeah as a
developer myself I can agree with that one I generally don't look at the code star Services because there's better offerings available exactly always have
been better and cheaper well yeah definitely but I will say with infrastructure as code with things like
cdk tying those services in is easy the problem is the services if they are better I'd be more likely to do it yep
yeah exactly I think it's a low barrier on that point it's a low barrier entry as well because those services are already I know
customers in the past have used them because they're there and it's easy to
get them up you don't have to use any other tests and sometimes it's just enough but in answer to your question
um thing that I guess it's my AWS wish list item which is still gone unfulfilled and
that is egress controls for Lambda so um so that's you know for those who
in the Enterprise um people get a bit sketchy at specially security folk when they realize their
Lambda functions run in a VPC that they don't control and therefore they don't know where the code's going so you can
you know you can audit your functions with code all you want but you don't really know where it's going so that's
why a lot of organizations mandate that it goes through the organizations egress
controls so therefore you've got to put a an eye on it which used to make it the
Lambda function really slow to start up gold start wise that's I think that's improved a lot these days I don't think
there's much difference it has that and um a regular one that's not running your
VPC but um a big one for me will be that and I'm hoping that'll come sometime you
know soon because I know a lot of people want it and it's definitely a priority on a lot of organizations lists because
once you have a VPC a lot of organs need apcs anyway but a lot of things they build they don't necessarily need a VPC
if you're building a VPC just be a Lambda function it's a bit of wastage there and the extra checks that you've
got to do and extra compliance and all those you know layers of
yeah like VPC lattice is one of those things that's easier for AWS to solve than than us yeah
yeah we're not particularly allowed to touch um you know do a functions as a service
type of things because there's no way or with no way to audit what's actually hitting the internet and therefore no
way to check if it's actually sending confidential things to a Dropbox or wherever some random
Hacker's website into your points earlier you know if somebody has gets the API keys and the access all the
access key and secret care they just change the Lambda there's nothing to stop it from taking all everything that they can see on your VPC if they're
connected and sending it straight out from the Lambda so it's a pretty big hole
um all right so AWS has a mixed record with naming their
services a very mixed record what do we think is the best named service that was
announced last year and the worst one I'm Gonna Be A Broken Clock like snap
start makes it quick to start like how much easier do you want it the worst
um again feel free to correct me anything with space Weaver the multiple simulations you can run it one time I
don't know what a space Weaver is but I want one a Sims AWS Sims waiver I believe that's it worse
yeah I know if it's a best name exactly and you
see I brought it up on my phone to check that it was correct but for most delightfully silly service name that
came out of reinvent this year yeah I think omix was an interesting one
it means something to people who use it but not to me if there's a terrible name
though I'm going to do something controversial here open search serverless
[Music] it is not serverless technically everything we use from AWS
is as serverless as you know as it's going to get because we don't have access to the service we're
just getting really meta at this point right yeah yeah I I think it prompted some very good discussion on what serverless is though because we've had
things like Aurora serverless Neptune serverless and for whatever reason open search serverless just seems to have
irked a lot of people because I think when I first read it I was thinking oh excellent like algolia or something
right this is excellent and then you look at it and it's like well you have compute units and you're going to be paying at least 720 a month and it's
like so you're just basically making it easier to point your indexes to different things on a cluster and it's
like yeah serverless no not at all
so I mean that was a very interesting one because it did kick off a lot of discussion in the Greater Community around what should serverless actually
be because I don't think we have a like there's a lot of different things you can look at and say yes that serverless
no that's not serverless what's the actual definition though that's an interesting one I think it's it's good
that discussion's been kicked off um for me best named I think was uh
distributed Maps so step functions distribute map does what it says on the tin um uh the other the demo they did on
that by the way was a whole bunch of um weather data for around the world and filled in a map of all the average
temperatures I think um so that went through I think it was like hundreds of Megs or weeks of of
small weather files over a month um worst name for me was I think
probably code Catalyst because it doesn't um so code catalyst is I think the
replacement for code star so code star is an unloved service from many years
ago which I don't think anyone uses which I suppose the concept is that it helps you with your pipelines helps
developers get their problems up and running to deploy their stuff uh code Catalyst appears to be a rethinking of
that I haven't used it and I think it's in preview um but um let's hope that it doesn't
become another unlocked service it could be that with that code star becomes the new simple workflow service
okay it could be that with that code star becomes the new simple workflow service
to be determined I'm I'm putting forward Sim Space Weaver as just the most delightfully silly name that came out of
reinvent I think there were a lot of good names there were a lot of logical names as far as worst
AWS really really needs to come up with a better naming scheme for instances because they're starting to get
extremely silly and it's starting to get to the point where nobody actually understands what any of them do yeah
that passed that point for me about three years ago
the strings of numbers and letters which are being put forward and going I have absolutely no idea what I would use any
of this for AWS really needs to come up with a better naming scheme or a better way to designate all of those instances
entirely because it really is starting to get to the point where nobody knows what any of them do this is where
keeping a tab amongst one of the thousands we all probably have open at a time of just what is this ec2 instance
comes really in handy oh yeah but I would like to have an Aiming team that's semi-logical so that
I don't have to keep referring back to that maybe they should have um it has a Chrome extension or
something so it just replaces on the console for you what does this ec2 instance type actually do and when
should you use it which is the really big one for me it's like okay you you understand the standard letter scheme if
you've used it for long enough you sort of understand that standard first letter scheme you will understand
things like the G designated for graviton you'll understand the numbers but it's that thing of there are so many
instances which are being used being released which are designed for specific really specialized use cases like the
sap the instances which are designed for sap deployments I know that they're there couldn't tell you which ones they
are are you trying to tell me my C7 dng9 M2 metal extra large is really big is that
real honest sounds like a Starbucks order
for me it's um T-Series C R and M they're the only
ones that don't remember yeah it's kind of like if you don't know how to read or what the insist does is probably not for you X2 ievdn or something like that I
think is the one that which is specialized for sap deployments and I'm amazed that I think I've pulled something close off the top of my head
so yeah please revisit the descriptions actually explain to people why they would use these different types of
instances that would be useful you mean we all don't just use T3 micros [Laughter]
so just a reminder to our audience here in the room and anybody watching online I'm coming up to the last couple of
questions that we've we've prepared our panelists for if you do have anything you'd like to ask them please drop it
into the YouTube chat or into the Melbourne channel on slack or if you're in the audience just pop your hand up
when we get to that we should just have time for a couple of questions from the audience all right so
um is there any services that we would like to talk about that we haven't spoken about so far I know we've covered probably 10 to 12.
um but there was a lot more than that announced for me personally as well again kind of going back onto the server world away
from serverless for a second but these things all matter um there's been more love given to Ena we've got the ENA Express we've actually
got not just instances but the actual Nix 400 um I think it's 400 gigabits a second
available for high performance compute it's not serverless at the moment and then and The Wider world you still have
these massive data centers or even kubernetes instances that are part of that that require that much throughput
and what that means for us is we're going to have a much larger i o throughput for data storage coming into
the future so that means for these ML workloads and AI workloads that will eventually be coming they are getting
ready for it we made it 45 minutes without a mention of kubernetes after the intro we did
pretty well but we haven't actually talked about containers or um service stuff at all so that's also a good one
to touch on if anybody has some cool stuff in that area something that I was really curious about was the blue green
deployments for RDS that's an interesting one because I I
think that's very much a case of AWS actually catering to some of the
realistic problems that people have in the way that they deploy systems if
you're dealing with anything that's got a significant Legacy component the reality is re-architecting that takes a
lot of time and a lot of money things like the blue green deployments for RDS I really like that because it's meeting
people halfway if you can make it easier for people to take that first step to get things into the cloud then
be it's like okay then it actually allows you to break down your migrations
into smaller bits rather than having to a phrase which I've become intimately
familiar with recently eat the whole elephant in one bite [Laughter] I was gonna say open the footage but I
like that one's exploring palaces portion Ed I think there's an interesting theme
that's come up here and that's the fact that AWS has started to actually focus a lot more on that on trying to meet
organizations halfway like Microsoft with Azure you know massive credit to Microsoft they've done a fantastic job
of trying to meet organizations halfway for a long time in terms of you know here are solutions that are not going to
be entirely Cloud native but they're going to be more hybrid they kind of led the way in you know what they called
Azure stack what we would call you know um what is it outposts yeah outposts
yeah and so I mean AWS just kind of reluctantly followed along with Microsoft they've kind of taken that
step forward that blue green deployment one is really interesting because I think a lot more of those AWS things now
are starting to focus on that fact if there's an entire customer base out there that we haven't touched really because a lot of people are still
looking at cloud and saying isn't that the thing that people put their data onto and then it all disappears off into
the dark web so a lot of organizations are very terrified of that and um one of the
um organizations that I'm a volunteer with so I'm a board director they're still terrified of cloud because isn't
that just someone else's computer as much as I try and convince people otherwise that's still a huge mentality out there meeting people halfway is a
massive way to actually kind of accelerate that cloud adoption um so for me EFS got a lot of love so
there's huge performance lower latency NFS is a thing a lot of people need it
for various reasons uh EFS does sips as well
fsx.6 uh the other thing AFS added was elastic
throughput so you don't necessarily if you don't necessarily know what throughput you need for the NFS file
share there's an elastic option to scale it up as required oh there's a little bit of a cost there but you know
everything costs money look let's not forget EFS is can also be used by a favorite service Lambda and if endpoint
is time okay bucket's not good enough may as well use it so it's good to see a lot of love being given to it and the
other thing around AFS I I had to use a a service that was announced well I
didn't really realize that it was a announcement that I used with a customer but they had a use case it was available
and then I looked back and I saw it was actually something that was announced during reinvent and that's um
uh FSX on tap service it's it's a big Niche but when an organization needs
fast file shares you can't be NetApp for that um
scaling up past what AFS can provide FSX on tap is really good the particular
part of that that was announced was multi-az endpoint that you can access from on-prem
so in their VPC so that was that was announced at reinvent as well and I
think that's good for a lot of people who need that that sort of functionality
cool so the last couple of questions that we have and we've got one from the audience are about
announcements the last couple of days particularly the Melbourne region did anybody in the audience have anything they wanted to ask about re invent
before we spend the last few minutes talking about that
that's the amount of coffees it was six six to keep you going while watching
so just for the online audience the question was did they have deep racer events or anything like that yes yeah
there was a deep Racing League I did not attend I did not either it was there for
those that were interested in there I remember that was a big thing in 2018 and now it's crickets
it's about four years old now we also had deep composer come out at one point let's not forget yes I remember the
little pianos that was 2019 I think wasn't it yeah yeah we actually had a deep racer track here at one point and then we used it like
twice and then yeah sold it it didn't last very long did it
everyone thinks they have the best sort of algorithm worked out I think I figured out the way this will work perfectly it works nicely in the
simulation you put it in the real car it just drives into the wall okay well that didn't work
any other questions from the audience that reinvent oh sorry yeah Daniel
yeah so a question for the online viewers uh
was I guess what was your favorite session or what was the session from RE invent that's online that you would most
recommend people watch uh Matthew it's a tough one
um well it can be more than one yeah I know so verna's keynote is a must watch by everyone that's
you know hands down gives you a good you know understanding of it the event driven
world we live in and let's just say that but the other the other just a regular session for me would be the distributed
map one which was on a Friday easy to get into when I was at the event um but it's well worth it's really
interesting um demo that they did and they described how it worked so yeah I like that one
just trying to get rid of the holiday cobwebs here um obviously Werner but then one that
gets kind of missed out because there's obviously the Monday night Madness that that event that keynote happens but
um slavsky's uh keynote was actually really impressive because it kind of showed the focus on the customer side as well it wasn't just him talking and
although he is charismatic um it's wonderful to see actual customers actually come up and present their use
cases saying like we're part of this we're part of this engagement showing that AWS is not just going and saying these are new Services these are people
that are engaging with us directly to bring you these new services cool
I think moving away from the Keynotes one of the sessions which I ended up watching online which was very entertaining so if anyone's not deep
into serverless or event-driven architecture and just wishes like can someone just explain this to me in a
simple way it's not going to put me to sleep there is a fantastic session from Eric Johnson who's one of the developer
Advocates with the serverless team at AWS his session is both an absolute master class in making sessions
entertaining and how you can actually make terms like identity sound really interesting so if you've ever looked at
stuff like serverless and it's like I really need to know about this stuff then that's a fantastic session by Eric
Johnson on event driven architectures apologies in advance in keeping with the
fact that I did go to things that were not recorded and given that I landed back in Australia on the 5th of January
I've got nothing for this one I do not think I went to a single session the whole time I was at reinvent that was
recorded no fair enough that's there's always there to watch anytime really and
given that given that I basically turned my U.S trip into a holiday
I have not had the time I can review anything yet so I'm sorry I
have nothing for this map look to be honest I'm amazed that anybody remembers anything since Christmas so you know that's it's been really good effort from
from all everybody I went to some great sessions I learned a lot of things I took a lot of low I took a lot of notes
I learned about Route 53 application recovery controller I learned a bunch about graviton I managed to make it to a
couple of the machine learning things so I did get to play a little bit with sagemaker which was really cool I took a
bunch of notes but none of that was recorded so Dawn's recommendation is if you can make it to reinvent go to the
things that aren't recorded yeah I guess the other
published which were run up reinvent and you have some AWS credits that you can go and go
play around with the workshops don't just think that it's all about watching things online workshops are probably the
most valuable things at the whole re invent with the exception of the chalk talk on graviton okay just on that so
some of depending on the presenter some of the chalk talks might actually be uh
on online um I think the catalog's still there so if
there was a chalk talk that was interesting you can always Google the the um the number and sometimes that'll take
you to especially service serverless land a lot of stuff ends up there um and the other thing is AWS Dash is a
good website um I think aws.com not sure something like that um which has a whole heap of stuff
including all the workshops and stuff should there should be a single source of Truth there cool we've got time for one last
question from the audience if anybody has anything no all right one thing is there any
services that we mentioned that we didn't explain well enough and the people would like to know more about it's a good one
silent VPC ladders yeah I guess if I was going
to put it some way it's instead of drilling a big hole through the wall between your vpcs and saying let's just
Chuck Transit Gateway in here and we'll just let all traffic go everywhere instead it becomes the case of from this
point with this authentication through IAM through this one particular point out to one other particular side so it
lets you make lots of smaller holes in your network rather than drilling these big things through and saying let's just route everything through here and giving
your security people an absolute terrifying nightmare instead it can be a case of I want to drill much smaller
holes much more precise things with authentication built in smaller nightmares Yeah well yeah good point if
you're comparing it to the on-prem world is when you're setting up your old infrastructure if using Cisco routers or
whatever route you're actually using you're pinpointing saying very specific things that can speak to others now we've actually got a finer grain level
of security and access inside of AWS on a similar level we're aware effectively saying specific Services while in the
old world you'll be saying specific IPS across different subnets and ranges and this subnet mask have access so we're kind of getting to know how the
sausage is made if you're not I mean the other the other way to think about it um if you're a networking person uh
layer 4 networking ditch that too hard too many controls you've got to put in place uh
application layer 7 controlling your application like a HTTP from here to here done so much easier I haven't used
it you know it might suck I don't know but sounds like it doesn't
it's basically that the explanation that I gave at the beginning it allows you to
do Crossing it allows you to do cross-account traffic natively within vpcs with as well as many other things
but for me the big takeaway of it is it allows you to if you've had an a a setup
where say you have each micro service runs in its own isolated account and I have heard AWS Solutions Architects
recommend that as a way of architecting systems you no longer have to plug it all together with intermediate Services
VPC lattice allows you to set up the connections so that you can split
everything out however you want to without needing to worry about the networking
another interesting point to the VPC lattice and this just kind of popped into my head then watching the talk
about that one of the big things they're also targeting is giving developers more freedom a choice of platform because
right now if you want to do things with you know um easy to or maybe you know certain things in containers your security and
your admin people will say Well it has to be in the VPC it has to meet these requirements and you can't have any overlapping IP addresses we'll have to
make sure you have you know exactly this stuff and it makes it very awkward for developers with this you know with the
service Discovery you can actually plug your Lambda function and just tell it go to the service network find this service
wherever it is amongst all of the accounts and all the services we've got set up and go talk to that and here's
your credentials to do so if you want to mix Lambda and containers and easy to yeah and it just makes it very
straightforward you don't need to play around with you know well let's build a VPC just to you know plug a hole straight through it yeah and it was
always one of the interesting things about across account VPC networking was
everyone who knew anything about this there is a whole genre of content for
AWS explaining to you how to design a VPC setup from scratch PPC lattice if it
works like it says on the tin and if it isn't completely changed by the time it gets to ga that all goes in the rubbish bin now
it's not necessary you don't need to understand how to do this and that IP overlap is a really
interesting one as well because I mean for any network admins in the room you know if you have a nice Network there
someone decides to put down like you know 192.168.0016 and then it's like okay
cool all about developers will use this or it's in our IAC code just to use this IP range and then cool we can't block
those networks together anymore where with VPC lattice or being at layer 7 you just tell it go find this service I
don't care what IP it is AWS go figure it out based on what the developers are configured it gets rid of ipam I don't
have to worry about IPS but I also have to worry about a specific individual or groups of individuals being The
Gatekeepers to how and what I what IPS I give to my thing yeah particularly given
that if you've got in a lot of organizational models you've basically got the vpcs are all managed by our
platform team that becomes like the organizations being managed by a you
know the org management account being managed by one group of people that's going to become a single point of value real quick again ask me how how I know
that speed of delivery at the end of the day yeah yeah remove all the bottlenecks I mean if I
think of it from my works and CIS admin on traditional systems then you'll typically have developers coming through
to say can we make these two systems talk with what I don't know just you know open all the ports between them oh
no okay right interesting do you know what we're going to be doing with it yet not really but you know can we just make
these things talk um no we can't and it's like okay cool can
we just have this thing having complete access out to the internet no no definitely not no it's like yeah but
this thing needs to be able to update it just talks to a CDN you know we don't really know what IP addresses or even DNS we just want it to be open just go
do it no no so it gives that sort of ability for admins to put that structure in place to
say here's the thing we're adding our security requirements we're adding our logging and you know policy enforcement
and then developers go and tie the stuff together however you want and if a developer says okay cool I want this
service to be out you know I want everything to be able to talk to this service you can say well this is on our
PCI network so no it does not have wild cards
and as someone who
knew we would like to open this to the Internet so that we can migrate a bunch of data in no no
migrate a bunch of data out get out of my office now well maybe if we put a
nice four to gate firewall right in the middle of it and around all traffic through that
I think a couple of people have had that experience that's like what it's like having Fort Knox but all the doors are open
yup yeah but it's all you know nicely compliant right we've checked our compliances security Architects are
happy look pen testing is great as long as that box is ticked right if it succeeded we call it involuntary pen
testing and everybody loves compliance free
tonight yeah in any other term in any other sector that would have some very terrifying
analogies all right so it sounds like we've got some very strong feelings about this particular Gap that AWS is closing uh so
it sounds like we're very thankful that it's done so just to wrap up then we've got a couple of minutes left
um just to have a quick couple of quick questions about the Melbourne region which everybody is excited for
um have you had a chance to play with it what was the first thing you did or what was the first thing you're planning to do in it
so I did a quick blog post about this the other day the first thing I did was well what do they even have in there so
that was the first thing you know between what kind of instances they have available what kind of services you're looking at about a quarter of the
services that Sydney has at the moment and a lot of those are kind of the kind of core Services built around the ec2
and the things like the management services so you have your ec2 your RDS you have your eks your Cloud watch all
those various things a lot of the machine learning Services aren't in there yet so you don't even have sagemaker in there yet
um and you don't even have any accelerated Computing so you have no GPU powered instances and only even a little
bit of graviton the interesting thing from that I guess is that at this point
very few customers are going to be green Fielding straight into Melbourne pretty much everyone is going to be doing some
kind of extension from the Sydney region so you have a lot of capability there as they get a lot you know as they get into
the next few months and again AWS has gotten a lot better at deploying these things and now the region is up I fully
expect within six months you're going to be having a pretty strong feature set within Melbourne
yeah for me it was the same I tried to actually go to a point where I'd spin up a couple instances I had some cdk that I
wanted to deploy across region and see how that goes and then I really was just playing with that's an interesting error
oh that's new ah launch failed why is that and working around that retrospectively though the one of the
biggest components of why the Melbourne region was so impactful is that low latency connections at a scale instead
of just working at the edge that means for all your melbournites you're going to be able to get bleeding edge
performance for very specific applications I think this is why I like and I think this is one thing not to forget and I give AWS all the respect
the world for this uh the supply chain for chips is still terrible so I'm not
surprised I can't blame them for it I I pretty much went
in in true in true chaos Gremlin fashion I basically went all right I'm not even
going to bother to look at the list of what's running here I'm not going to try and do anything I'm going to take the terraform code that I'm writing as a
proof of concept for the serverless Meetup and just plug AP Southeast for in there and see what happens and I got a
entirely impressive list of error messages so that was good I.E stress tested it I confirmed that
the Melbourne region does exist I confirmed that terraform hasn't really worked out what to do
that yet um the only thing I did to be boring is now for instance watch my low pings feel good
um uh the other thing that I noticed today when I tried to log into the console
after it had logged me out um if your url is pointing at AP
Southeast for and you try to log in it'll give you an error you can't do that there must be some IAM thing that's
not working so you have to change it back to Sydney to log in and send you back to fall so I think it's a little
bit of a yeah a glitch but yeah also I did not forget to do this but if
you intend to play with Melbourne make sure you go and turn it on because new regions in AWS are not are not uh turned
on by default that was the first thing I checked after terraform started throwing error messages was I think I remember
turning it on did I actually do that yes I had and I guess that's one of the things is
that as soon as you start building across regions you're going to have some very big architectural headaches you're going to start having you know those
things of network traffic you're going you know you have all these kinds of challenges the two big things are if you
have a need either around performance or resilience if you need that you know the
single digit latency within Melbourne it's fantastic you know if the services are available it's definitely worth doing or if you really need that high
level of resilience and I know of at least one um company I've been talking to who've been interested in this since the
announcement because um in this particular case they do a lot with um public sector stuff and have that really high resilience need you
know what if the entire Sydney region goes down now we have the Melbourne region which is fantastic but there's
always that thing that we're going to have to build the architecture to actually support and extend our services across the boundary so it's that
question of at what point do we start saying yes it's now worth it a big issue kind of arises from that now is it's a
bit of a meta comment to look at is do we look at azs or do we look at regions if cost is not a problem should I be
spinning up three azs in Sydney and then as maximum in Melbourne technically no do I have the right failover options
what are my failover options and I think we've been initially blessed with one region and there's a caveat I say to
blessed is what we haven't had to actually think of that all we had to do is look at speculative designs from others and hope for the best now we're
in a scenario where I truly think that there'll be attempts at the multi-region deployments across the board using
platform services and I think we're really going to see AWS not AWS rather the local community kicking into gear
with some trillionic solutions that hopefully don't include a Fortinet there's a multi-rage in white paper
um I think was released in the last year December it was on December yeah it's pretty recent
um that's quite timely um and the other thing is a lot of people don't need multi-region people have lived with Sydney for so long
um I think they're going to think they need more they're going to think they do and there'll be lots of projects rolled up
you know spun up to do multi-region and then they'll realize oh maybe it's a bit harder than I thought especially if I'm
not using Cloud native services so you know it's got to think long and hard about that it's gonna be a lot of fun Bill shocks coming up when people don't
realize that transferring data between Regis costs money and one of the really interesting things to me about performance is City and Melbourne are in
the Great scheme of things are actually not that far away from each other having just come back from a trip where I took
all together too many flights within the US there's a much greater need when you're dealing with you know big
countries that span think it's four time zones if four time
zones in the continental US dealing with those really big countries that's where the greater need is
around performance being able to say work out based on based on location pink
do you want to send someone to U.S east once or Northern Virginia East Coast or do you want to send them to us West
Tucson Oregon West Coast um there's a much greater and much
greater performance impact when you're dealing with countries that have a large countries or areas that have a large
geographical footprint like the us or Europe in Australia the difference between Sydney and Melbourne for the
vast majority of use cases is going to be absolutely negligible and please do bear that in mind because you will get
Bill shock really really quickly just a note a bit of statistics about 15 to about 20 milliseconds at most
that's it yep yeah and that uh I guess the point around data transfer as well if you do
want to build you know a nice multi-region capable solution exactly you know as the white paper kind of gives you
um you don't just go ahead and extend your ec2 instances you also need to extend your databases you need to extend your storage you might need to have your
replication across both of the regions to say okay we now have this S3 bucket
if it's part of our solution and we want to be truly fault tolerant you know in case of any kinds of outages it needs to
be duplicated across the regions too that means twice as much storage and all the data transfer that goes along with as well yeah and the likelihood is that
if you're dealing with a use case which has that redundancy requirement you will already be doing this in a different way
it might be that you're replicating to Singapore might be that you're replicating to another AWS region it
might be if you've got data sovereignty issues and you really need that capability you're actually going to a different cloud or you're going
somewhere else um whether that be you know for a disaster for a sort of Disaster Recovery
Solution or whether it not be the likelihood is that if you have the
requirement for that level of redundancy you are already doing it in some manner that's the point at which you then think
about okay how are we re-architecting this into Melbourne I'm sorry just to add to that point
um one of the things is look at when it comes to This Disaster Recovery portion side is that a multiple region isn't
just about hey I can now have more availability and level of sovereignty you've got more kit available one of the
biggest issues in Sydney at the moment is you can't get a GPU instance for the life of you because there will be so much taken off in a quick instance
having another whole region a new state to actually look at means in not six months from now but a year from now the
compute capacity of Australia would have doubled just from that so that means we can then go through and do some
geospatial uh training we can train AI models using the cloud and we won't have
to sit there going it's been an hour when do I get my GPU
I think to paraphrase The Simpsons it's going to be a golden age for consultancies in Australia because
everybody's going to be wanting to go multi-region and you guys are going to be lining up opening suitcases taking all the money I don't think any of us
who work for consultancies who are going to be out of a job in the near future which is always a nice thing to be able
to say all right so one last question from the online audience to wrap up with do you have any speculation on where the
actual data centers are located in Melbourne without breaching any ndas if you do know anybody want to guess
I'm getting a lot of trouble by saying things so I'm just going to say like another confirm Northern ire and I played the fifth
no sounds like nobody wants to take that punt no
I can't say anything sorry David you'll need to find them and and buy them a drink and see if we can talk to them get
them out of them that way all right thank you very much everybody we're right on time so we'll wrap it up there uh thanks again for participating in the
panel this year so yeah thanks [Applause]
all right I and you want to wrap it up grab that one
place it over there
so I'll just start talking anyway
that was a very interesting pal thank you all for
all the information I'm sure everybody else had fun and
learned as much as I did so now we've reached uh Marketplace

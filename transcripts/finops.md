# FinOps 101: How to Stop Your Cloud Workload from Breaking the Bank

ROB: Thanks Arjen, thanks Guy.  Great look at the news as always.  Alright, so, tonight we have our, erm, our regular contributor Dawn.  Ah, we are very thankful for all the presentations Dawn has done so far this year, we're looking forward to another good one tonight.  Ah, Dawn, if you're able to share your screen?

DAWN: Uh, one moment please, as I try to work out how the technology actually works here.  Erm, and realize that I've- that I'm not on my title slide!  Never the greatest start.  All right, are we working?  Can you see a presentation?

ROB: Yes, I can.  All right.

DAWN: Most excellent!

ROB: [inaudible] over to you.

DAWN: Awesome, ah, hello, everyone!

ROB: Sorry, I'll just switch this over.

DAWN: Hello, everyone!  I am glad to once again be back here at the Melbourne AWS User Group from the comfort of your own homes.  So - so far this year I've looked at security, I've looked at governance, and now I'm going to look at one of the other big themes that both centralised teams and the C-Suite tend to care about, and that is cost management.  So tonight we are looking at FinOps 101, or, affectionately known as, 'How to Stop Your Cloud Workloads Breaking the Bank'.

So - I'm fairly sure that most of the people here are probably sick of my introduction by now, but for those of you who don't know who I am - my name is Dawn, I am an associate DevOps/SRE person at MYOB, and - if I want to prove my own cost saving credentials, I can dress for the opera for less than five dollars if I have to.  The most expensive part of that outfit was the stockings, which cost me two dollars fifty.  Outside of work, I am an occasional author and kitchen alchemist - sometimes that ends well, sometimes it doesn't.  I am also a raging sportsball fan, which is why that picture of me is me at Marvel Stadium.

Now - in the tech world we have an awful lot of buzzwords.  And this friendly little hand-drawn bee here would like to remind you of some of the ones that we tend to run into.  We've got things like the Internet of Things, big data, machine learning and blockchain.  We've got buzzwords that you would tend to see more from technical people; things like cloud native, test driven development, or DevOps.  So we've got all of these buzzwords, and FinOps basically just sounds like another buzzword - I mean, you've got DevOps and SecOps, so FinOps presumably just follows on from that, right?  And why should we care?

Well - FinOps isn't quite like DevOps or SecOps.  It stands for financial operations, and what it's really about is the idea of trying to get more bang for your buck in the cloud.  So it doesn't mean that we're throwing out all of our EC2 instances and changing them to `t2.micro`s because that's cheaper.  It's really about understanding - why you're using the compute power that you're using, and how you can make sure that you're using it as effectively as possible.  And that can involve a lot of different things.  It can involve working with teams to understand and manage their spend, because, often, if you have developers that don't have a huge amount of understanding of cloud computing, they might not even have looked at an AWS bill before.  All of the cloud providers, including AWS, do have their own cost management tools, which is another thing that you can leverage when you're looking at FinOps.  And finally, if that doesn't cut it, you can use third-party tools with more advanced features if you really need to save more money.  We will talk more about the cost benefit trade-off there later.

Now, when I came and talked here two months ago, ah, we met the great people at the company ProductCorp.  For those of you who didn't hear that talk, let's meet ProductCorp again.  They're a startup with a head office in Sydney, they were founded approximately five years ago, and they offer two main products.  They have a product called BuyIt, which is basically inventory management software as a service.  They also have SellIt, which is a managed online shopping platform, so something similar to Shopify.  And most importantly, for our purposes tonight, all of ProductCorp's infrastructure runs on AWS.

We have - a few different people at ProductCorp that we need to meet.  We've got Annie Jones, who is ProductCorp's current CFO, and she originally worked for an auditing firm.  Now, as you would remember from our previous talk on Control Tower, Annie is primarily focused on value for money, And she's been watching with a bit of concern as ProductCorp's cloud spent has slowly been creeping up after their organizational restructure.,  And she wants to know, is this increased cloud spend benefiting the company at the moment?  And if not, how can it?

And in order to find that out, she is going to work with Ben Nguyen.  They're ProductCorp's lead cloud engineer, and they have about 10 years of experience, mainly working for startups.  They're very passionate about improving infrastructure, and one of the things that they're hoping to be able to do with this - is to, as well as get a better understanding and visibility into the amount of money that's being spent, to make sure that teams are spending that money efficiently, and in a way that sort of advances the aims of the company and advances the quality of their software.

So what's the problem?  Well, if you saw my Control Tower talk that I gave a couple of months ago, you may remember that - basically, ProductCorp is aiming to move all of their - their products BuyIt and SellIt, from a monolith architecture to a microservices architecture, and as part of that, they've restructured their AWS accounts to move those into separate production accounts.  They've also added a dev account per microservice that's being built, and a lab account per team so that teams have somewhere to play around with things that they might want to do.  That's been really good, and it's allowed them to resolve a lot of outstanding issues that they had.  Unfortunately, since this happened, their cloud sp- their cloud spend has increased by 400 percent month on month.  And for a very small company, that is potentially unsustainable.  So Annie wants to understand why the costs have increased, and she wants to make sure that their development teams have the support that they need to manage those costs in the future.

So Annie and Ben sit down, discuss the problem, and they brainstorm some solutions.  This is what they come up with.  The first thing that they talk about is the idea that they need to go out and talk to each development team about how much their costs have increased, and they need to understand why that is.  Because if you've got suddenly got 10 or 15 times as many customers, and you're having to scale up all of your workloads for that, obviously that's a really good use of increased cloud spend.  Whereas if you've got a bunch of resources that are running in lab accounts that nobody's shut down after they've experimented, that's not such a good use of money.  Then - Ben makes Annie aware that they can use the provider dashboards to actually break down AWS costs and give teams some visibility into their usage.  So as well as the central billing portal, they can encourage their developers to have a look at the billing for each account, which allows them to break down, okay, are we spending money efficiently?  Do we understand what we're spending?  And - if we've got resources that we don't need, can we shut some of those down?

# Finding the right tools for your new job - Transcript

Hello, and welcome to AWS She Builds!  My name is Dawn, and during the day, I'm a - DevOps, DevSecOps, SRE type person.  I like - exploring things, I like automating things, I like making things secure.

But outside of work, I am an occasional author and kitchen alchemist.  And I don't describe myself as a kitchen alchemist because - I like to cook, although I do.  It's partly because I like to experiment in the kitchen.  I like to try new recipes.  I like to try and cook things that people have cooked for me.  And sometimes that turns out really well, and sometimes it's a total disaster.

One thing that I've never been able to master the art of cooking, no matter how much I've tried, is latkes, which are a type of potato pancake that is very common in Israel, and in Jewish communities.  I love them - I cannot cook them to save my life. And this has become - a running joke, between myself and one of my friends, that - I cannot cook latkes.

So, when I went to visit her, over the weekend a couple of weeks ago, and she said to me 'what do you want for dinner?', I said 'well, hey, why don't we give latkes a try, [laughs] so that you can teach me all of the things that I've been doing wrong?  And then- maybe I'll be able to competently cook them.'

So, I get to my friend's place, we go through the day, it comes time to cook, I go into the kitchen to help - you know, we puree the onions, we grate the potatoes, we get out the seasoning.  And then it comes to making matzah meal.  Matzah being a type of cracker, an unleavened cracker that again, is very common in Jewish communities and Jewish culture.  And, in order to make latkes well - as my friend told me - you need to get matzah down to a breadcrumb-like consistency, so that it doesn't go soggy when you cook it in hot oil.

So okay.  We crack the matzah in half, we run them through the food processor, and what we get back is basically just bits of smashed-up cracker.  Way too big to put in, because if we put them straight in - it's just going to go soggy.

So, my friend and I are - standing in the kitchen, talking about this problem, and then my friend's kid comes into the kitchen and points at the mortar and pestle.  And he says 'hey, why don't we give that a try?'  So - we do.  We grab some of it, we stick it in the mortar and pestle, and yeah, it certainly gets it smaller, but it takes a long time to get it down to the consistency - that we need.  So again - back to the drawing board.

And then, my friend is looking around the kitchen, and her eyes happen upon the blender.  Well, the blender's usually used to make smoothies, but - it's good at crushing things, right?  So we take the contents of the food processor, we dump them straight into the blender, we run the blender, and in three minutes, we have perfect matzah meal, the consistency of breadcrumbs, that goes straight into the bowl for the latkes, which turn out to be absolutely delicious.

So why am I telling you a story about cooking latkes in a talk about technology?  Well - it's because it actually illustrates a concept that I - tend to use in my day to day work, and that I want to talk to you about today - which is the concept that, there's never a right tool for every single scenario.  There's only a right tool for particular jobs.

And we can see this if we look at programming languages.  Something like Java is, uh- very common in the enterprise world, because the way that it's structured, the scalability, and the usability - the re-usability that it allows, are very good for those large-scale enterprise projects.  Then you can look at something like Golang, which is a fairly new programming language that was developed by Google for- site reliability engineering.  And it tends to be used a lot for site reliability engineering, and also for scripting.  SO if you want to create a command-line tool, Golang is something that's very commonly used for that these days, and that's because it's quite fast, it's quite easy to learn, and there's only one right way to do things.  And Golang tends to be very good at steering you away from the wrong way to do things.  So if you need to build something that's small and fast, it's a really good choice for that.

We can also then look at - automation and pipelining tools, for continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment.  Now, one that I've used a lot is Github Actions, and there are two reasons for that.  The first one being that it's really easy, and the second one being that it's free for open-source.  So if you have a workload that you need to run, to push up an open-source tool to somewhere where - like a package manager, where people can consume it, or if you need to push it up to a production environment, Github Actions is a really good choice.  On the other hand, at work, I've tended to use Jenkins, which is a great choice for us at work, because - we can manage it ourselves, so we can make sure it's always up to date, we can run it on our workloads, we don't have to worry about it.  And for a lot of companies in Australia that don't want to take on that management work, another really common choice is Buildkite, where you can spin up your own agents, where all of that management overhead is done by Buildkite and not by you.  So again - no right tools, just the right tools for the job.

So if you're coming in to a new job, or you're starting a new project, or you and your team are building something from scratch, how do you work out what the right tools for the job are?

For me that often comes down to - asking questions.  If you're building something from the ground up, you can ask a lot of questions like: how do we think this is going to work?  What do we see the pitfalls being?  Have any of us - you know, have any of us built anything similar before?  What went well?  What went wrong?  And that can inform, not only the choice of tools that you use, say the choice of programming language, the choice of other tooling, but it can also then inform the way that you architect that thing.  Like - sometimes you'll want to use particular types of databases.  You might want to use an SQL database for some applications, and a NoSQL database for others.

Another fairly common - thing that I like to look at in terms of this is - if you ever read the Agile Manifesto, which is [laughs] not actually as tall of an order as it sounds, it talks - one of its, sort of, main bullet points is - people over process.  And the way that I like to word that in my day-to-day work is that we need just enough process to support people in doing their jobs.  A really good example, again with continuous deployment software: a friend of mine works for a company that handles payments, and therefore they need to be PCI compliant.  So - when they were looking at a new continuous deployment tool, they specifically decided that they wanted something where, if someone went into Jira, and put in an approval for a particular ticket, then that deployment would only happen if that approval had gone in.  It allowed then to have a clear audit trail, that meant that they could show PCI compliance.  Absolutely not appropriate for your average open-source project, but completely appropaite for a scenario where security is really important, and where you need to be able to show that paper trail to an auditor.

And so again, you can start asking questions around that, of - what kind of things do we need, what are the constraints of the project?  What are the things that are really important?  What are the things that are not so important?  If you already have all of your workloads on Kubernetes, then tools that you can spin up on Kubernetes will be a very good choice.  Whereas if everything is managed by a cloud provider like AWS, it will be a much better choice to hook into a lot of those tools that that cloud provider provides for you.  And so again, that's about asking that kinds of questions that will lead you to - the right tool for this particular job.

As an aside, one thing that- all of the really good senior engineers that I've worked with have said is that it's very important to have junior engineers, career changers, people coming from different perspectives in teams.  Because if you have people whose background isn't in coding, or who are fresh out of university and don't have that much experiences, the way that they learn is by asking questions.  And that forces the senior people, who have a lot of knowledge - to actually go back and challenge their assumptions.  The way that things have been done previously, isn't always the correct way to do things now.

And that's a really good example of recovering from process-induced failure.  Where you might have people who have a lot of experience, or who have worked their whole careers in a particular niche, who will tend to do things one particular way. But when they're challenged, can take a couple of steps back and say hey, maybe we should try something different.  A really good example of this is that a lot of large companies in Australia and around the world, are now starting transformation initiatives, where they're basically trying to run things internally, like a startup.  It's something that a lot of big banks are doing.  Because they have these huge workloads in datacentres, that there's no way thaey can migrate, and so, it's easier for them just to start from the beginning, and have people who come in and question a lot of those assumptions, like - can we meet our security requirements while- doing everything in the cloud?  That's an assumption that a lot of people haven't questioned, but as part of some of these big transformation intiatives, that's what a lot of these big companies are questioning now.

And sometimes it does get to the point where you just have to throw it all out and start again, but - even if you're in the middle of a project, you can often take a couple of steps back, and think hey, how much effort is it actually going to take us to re-architect this?  A good example of this is a situation where we had a shared datastore, and realised that that exposed us to a lot of risk, because if one product went down, we would potentially lose data on a lot of different products.  And so we decided okay, we are going to take that shared datastore, and we are going to split it out.  Having people question whether that was the right choice allowed us to actually recover from that process-induced failure, and try something different.

And the other reason, why I like using kitchen anecdotes to talk about tech, is because - failure is inevitable and expected.  But what's important is what you learn from it.

So, knowing all of this, if you want to pitch yourself to take on a new project, if you want to pitch yourself to a new job, what can we learn, then, from this idea of finding the right tools for the job?  Well, one thing that I think is very important to talk about here - and we can look at these sort of transformation initiatives that a lot of big companies are undertaking now, is that it's important to have people with different perspectives in the room.  So a lot of these people who are running these transformation initiatives at big, old, established compaines, are not people who've been Head of IT for companies that have datacentres their entire lives, it's people who've come from startups.  It's people who've come from much more flexible, Agile environments, where they're focusing more on, what's the minimum that we can deliver?  How can we have a minimum viable product?  How do we spin this stuff up quickly?  How do we make sure that we meet the requirements with the minimum amount of work on our part?  And if we wanted to switch cloud providers overnight, how would we go about doing that?

And it applies as well for - a lot of the types of people for whom She Builds is the audience. People who are- underrepresented in technology, people who may be career changers, who may have taken time out of the workforce.  Transferable skills, from other things that you have done in your life, are a really important part of selling yourself.  Because you can provide a different perspective that will allow employers to find the right tool for the job.  And universally, the really good hiring managers that I've dealt with have always talked about this.  The idea of getting people with different experiences and different perspectives into the room.

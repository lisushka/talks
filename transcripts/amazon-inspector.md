# Automating security checks with Amazon Inspector - Transcript

DAWN: Good evening, everyone.  I hope that you're all keeping well in these trying times. I'm here tonight to tell you- a story. It is a story about a production incident, it is a story about how we debugged it, and it is a story about how we resolved it.  Ah, during the story, I, live, we'll be answering questions- through the Slack channel and the YouTube comments, so if you do have any questions throughout the presentation, feel free to just type them in, and I will respond to them as we go.

So, first of all, I should probably tell you a little bit about who I am. My name is Dawn.  I am an associate DevOps/SRE at MYOB - I have worn both hats - and I am something of an auth- automation enthusiast.  The, sort of, phrase that I like to use to describe this is: why fix it twice when you can automate it once?  If you have a production issue, I don't want to see that being something where you have runbooks and you- deal with it every time it occurs.  I want people to automate solutions, and I like to see things to be fixed permanently.  Outside of work, I am an occasional author and kitchen alchemist; sometimes that ends really well, sometimes it doesn't.  I am also a raging sportsball fan, which is why that picture of me is me at Marvel Stadium.

So - the story that I'm going to tell you tonight starts with a warning. And this warning came not from someone that I was employed with, but from a friend of mine who is fairly well connected to the- security landscape in- IT, and particularly in terms of Microsoft products.  They basically warned me that- there was a zero-day vulnerability that was about to come out from Microsoft, and told me that, when I went into work the next day, I should make sure- that we patched all of our instances.  So, I- filed that information away, get into work the next day, and sure enough, as soon as I arrive into work, it is announced that there has been a zero-day vulnerability from Microsoft, and- part of the zero-day vulnerability that was disclosed is a vulnerability that targeted the Remote Desktop Protocol, which allows you to remote into machines that are hosted somewhere else from your local computer.  That- vulnerability allowed arbitrary code execution, and I'm fairly sure that everyone here will have some understanding of why that could potentially be an issue.  So, my colleagues and I, with the warning in mind, sat down.  We looked at what we were working with, tried to get our head around it, and then we got to work.

Effectively, the problem that we were dealing with, without wanting to give away too much about our production infrastructure, was that we had workloads running on Amazon EC2 instances which were accessible via remote desktop protocol, and - in some cases, when you have, ah, workloads that are accessible through EC2, they are effectively accessible to the whole internet.  Now, the way that you lock that down is by using security rules on your, ah, VPCs and security rules on your security groups, which will lock that access down to- a subset of IP addresses.  Usually ,you'd be looking at a corporate VPN.  The problem with that is that if you mess that up, then- those instances can potentially be open to- the entire Internet.  As many people in this industry have found out at various points, to their detriment.

So, in order to actually resolve this issue, what we basically needed to know was not, how are we going to take these instances down and immediately patch them?  It was more, could someone have exploited the vulnerability already, have we got configurations that are potentially open to the Internet, and how much time do we have to patch our instances?  And are there any quick fixes that we can come up with, that will actually buy ourselves some time to plan out our patching strategy, work out what we want to do, and not have to just take instances down in the middle of the day, which is what we would potentially have had to do if we were responding to this reactively.

Enter Amazon Inspector.  Effectively, Amazon Inspector is- a tool that you can use to check the security of EC2 instances.  So- at its simplest, it will scan for- network-related issues, like, do you have any ports that are open to the Internet, do you have methods of access that should be locked down?  And in its more complex form, it can actually look at are you running software that doesn't meet security best practices, you know, are you running software that has known vulnerabilities in it?  And it's something that can be used both proactively and reactively, so you can automate it, you can integrate it into your build pipelines - we'll get to that later - but in this case, we wanted to use it reactively, so- we basically wanted to just run a quick check, see whether there were any security issues that we could solve quickly, which would then buy us time to- sit down and plan out how we were going to take the instances offline.

Now, Amazon Inspector has different tiers- of recommendations.  You've got high-risk recommendations, medium-risk recommendations, low-risk recommendations, and informational recommendations.  The high-tier findings are- sort of the really egregious misconfigurations; the okay, these are things that you need to respond to immediately, all your ports are open to the Internet, that's a problem.  Medium and low-tier findings are generally things that you should investigate, understand why it is that you're getting those warnings back.  Some of those may be acceptable, depending on the way that your instances are configured and what you're trying to actually do with them, but generally those are the sorts of things that you want to look into and see, can you improve this?  Informational findings indicate a potential security issue that's not currently active, but- they are findings that you can sort of- look at and will give you some more information about where you might focus your efforts in the future.

And the best thing that Amazon Inspector is it's really easy to get started with it.  So, here we're looking at a screenshot from an AWS account that has never used Inspector before.  You get a page that gives you some information on- what it does and how to use it - most of that's cut off because of my screen resolution - but- in order to get started with this, we just need to hit the- the button in the middle of the page that says `Get Started`.  And that will bring us to- a view that looks something like this.

So we- h- note here that Amazon Inspector has two different types of assessments that we can run; we can run network assessments and we can run host assessments.  So the network assessments are basically just looking at the networking configuration, in the sense of, you know, do we have ports that globally reachable that shouldn't be, have we got a VPC that's perhaps not locked down, have we got instances that should be private but are actually public, and those sorts of things.  And we also have host assessments, which are a little bit more complex and cost a little bit more - we'll get into the pricing later - which are looking for things like known vulnerable software and are benchmarking your instances against security best practices.

Now, there is also an option for some advanced configuration, so let's briefly take a look at that.  What we see here is- this basically allows you to configure what you're actually doing a bit more fine-grained.  So maybe you want to look at security best practices, but you don't want to look at common vulnerabilities, you have the option to- cut down, sort of the scope of what it is that you're actu- that you're actually looking at, and you can do all of that here.  But for the purposes of this, what we're going to do is we're just going to take it and we're going to run the standard assessment.  Now- you can't see it, again, because of my screen resolution, but at the bottom of the page you have the option to run Amazon Inspector once or to schedule it to run weekly.  Ah, scheduling it to run weekly is something that's good if you want to- get constant updates on what your security posture looks like.  You can also integrate it into your CI/CD pipelines - again, that's something that we're going to look at later, but for now we're just going to run this once, and see what the findings are that we get back.

Now, what I've done is I've created a couple of EC2 instances which are configured in- ways that will basically give us findings back.  So, Amazon Inspector will take a couple of minutes to run, and then we can have a look at the findings.  Now, as we can see there, we've got a couple of informational findings, we've got a couple of low-risk findings, we've got a medium-risk finding.  So if we take a look, a- indeed, at one of those low-risk findings, what we actually find here is - or this is one of the informational findings - what we actually find here is it's telling us we have these groups of ports that are open to the Internet.  Now, in some situations that would be a concern, but what this setup actually is is it's taken from something that I did for AWS Programming and Tools, and it's the setup that you would use to run an open-source video conferencing software called BigBlueButton on EC2.  So that large range of UDP ports that's open, that range is open because BigBlueButton requires it to be open in order to be able to parse video and audio information through the software.  So in this case, although we are getting an alert back, this is working as intended.  However, if we go and take a look at that medium-risk alert that we had, which is one of the ones that you probably be concerned about, what we find here is that that's TCP port 22, which is the SSH port, which is open to the Internet.  And - again, when you're dealing with vulnerabilities that could potentially cause arbitrary code execution, I'm sure I don't need to explain to everyone why this configuration is a bad idea.

So, we've seen now what Amazon Inspector's findings will generally look like - let's take this one step further and let's actually automate it into a CI/CD pipeline.  Now, for this I am using Azure Pipelines, and I recognize that, considering that this is an AWS meetup, this is a little bit sacrilegious.  There are a couple of reasons why I'm doing that, though.  The first one is, Azure Pipelines is very simple, and surprisingly, it actually integrates really well with AWS, with some of the tools that have been built in the Azure Pipelines marketplace.  But the main reason that I'm doing this is that - Azure Pipelines has a free tier, and is also free for open-source.  So, I can throw all of this code up on Github, which I have done, and- you can then fork it and try it yourself in Azure Pipelines, without having to pay anything.  If you want to take a look at that code, the link is here.

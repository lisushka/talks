# Melbourne AWS User Group Podcast: Season 2, Episode 2 - Transcript

hello everybody and welcome to the Melbourne AWS User Group podcast season 2 episode 2. today we'll not be talking about news or rather we will be talking about news but it's a different kind of news because we'll be focusing on our new shiny Melbourne region and to do so I'm joined by Matt Muriel super excited and Jason Woods hey hello world for one and of course we're also joined by Don hi good to be here again um back from running around the US for probably all together too long well it's good to have you back here just in time for the super special episode so shed a new region we've been waiting for it for a bit over two years I think I forgot to look up exactly when it was announced reinvent 2020. so slightly over two years and it was promised in the second half of last year yeah nearly a month off reasonably close built up that Christmas excitement and then just lift the thing in yeah but now it's here pop the pop pop the champagne everybody's problems to solve uh wish you all a good night talk to you later maybe not maybe maybe not maybe not if you you know but at least if you've got your basic uh interests then um hey you know we've we've got your Basics covered so I think I speak for all of us when I just at the outside I want to make it clear that we're really happy that this region is here um that were excited about it and that everything we're going to say from this point on forward is set with utmost of love and just that we wish we could fast forward the region by about a year to make it useful we're customers we deserve the right to want more yeah yes yes happy happy ski it's pretty much what we expected but it's not what we want but we want all the shinies not just you know the the important Chinese yeah and the old Chinese basically yeah yeah you know there are some interesting things though as saying you pointed out in other places the um you know the the standard free tier now changed to uh your T3 yeah and so there's um there was some you know logical but you know surprising things that we weren't expecting there so you know that was an interesting yeah so just as a recap we're recording this on Wednesday the 1st of February so hopefully a few things we say will be completely outdated by the time you're actually listening to this yeah that that would be nice but yes you know if you're going back and having a having a look at you know what did we say last year then yeah hopefully everything's there but hopefully people will listen to this sooner than than any years time I hope so otherwise I will have felt badly with the editing uh we have faith in you alien but yeah generally speaking let's have a look for a moment on what we have in our new shiny region so there are a total of 48 services that are in one form or another available so just because it says the service is available be clear that does not mean that everything from that service is available obviously big point there is easy to you won't get every single instance type in your new written you want to get a lot of instance types in your new shiny region yeah and you know maybe not in every AZ as well which was something that we'd saw in Sydney for quite some time you know so that's something else to to be aware of um now I know a few times we had you know some customers here in Sydney that then wanted to uh try a uh at the uh sort of in a different AZ but that was the the incense type was in two azs but not the third one which just happened to be the one that they wanted to uh to to test in So yeah so there are some things that you'll need to to be aware of and check out when even you know when incense types are there um yeah it's happened before it could very well happen again with Melbourne um so you know yeah just be aware yeah exactly as Matt earlier alluded to that really isn't a lot of instance types available right now so on the AMD 64 side so the original pre-gravidon type instances we have more choices but that's all last generation still so it's the R5 c5s and m5s none of the sixes there and as well the d3s and I3 instances and those are the only ones that are available at the moment which I carefully checked by clicking in the console and seeing every other option grayed out or not so obviously new instance types will show up over time all the instance types just won't appear and that's why something like the D3 is now on the D3 micro is now our free tier instance type which is nice and something I should do in every other region as well but the disappointing thing I guess for from sort of where I'm sitting we've been unfortunate oh and by way I mean uh Australians um have been unfortunate in that for years now uh we've only had a single region and this was kind of the one shoot to go yay multi-region Dr multi-region failover where you've got data sovereignty or latency concerns can actually be a real thing and at least as it stands today yeah probably not as drop in replace as we were probably hoping it's pretty clear that regardless of whether or not you use ec2 RDS any of those sorts of core Services you're either going to need to have been very lucky in the instances you picked in Sydney or you're going to have to do an apples and oranges to get it to to work which yeah are you better to do apples and oranges now or are you better to wait and see how long it takes them to iterate on a new region because if you look at the AWS news RSS feed every other post is about AWS releasing services in a region somewhere time will tell how quickly they add to Melbourne my gut feel is probably won't start straight away my guess is they probably want to bed down what they've got first before you know expanding too rapidly but hey I've been wrong numerous times before and I'm sure I'll be wrong again maybe this is one of them maybe it's not yeah but I mean at least with that VR law if your main concern is your data then you know at least the basics you know S3 buckets your you know EBS volumes if you could get those sides of things across no EFS I did not mention any of this that's that's the one that's the one that caught me out was yes uh no yeah I I not quite loved that up in the available Services just yet so I was like yes I know I know S3 will be there I know EBS is there and then just say too that along with that you know one of the services that I was a little bit disappointed with that didn't launch was AWS backup you know which I think I feel some pretty cool service if you want to run you know ec2 instances you know I mean that they're just still got your abs snapshots and it looks like that a lifecycle manager is there so you can lifecycle manager's not terrible so at least you'll you can do something there to protect any instances you've got it's it's nowhere near as featured as AWS backup or you know some of the third party ones but it's serviceable but yeah you know I would have liked or seen awares back up in um but uh yeah so but yeah with some sales system actually one of the big ones I also find that's missing is something simple like Transit Gateway um if you need if you create or if you're going to use a new region it is usually considered a nice thing to be able to connect to it from the old one yeah yeah definitely that's that's sort of a big one that's um that's that's missing because yeah you want to try and keep your networking consistent and your Transit Gateway um yeah that's that's a big output yes with everything let's fingers crossed and hope that's you know I hope that one's that's one that will come sooner rather than later um so yeah and just to go back a little bit on the um the ec2 instances so just having a look at the at the pricing page which has the number of instances so Sydney currently has 434 available instances and Melvin has it seems like 118 let me just flip back to it yeah 118 in some floats so yeah there's about a quarter of available instances there that's actually better than I thought when I just did the official search in the console yeah it might be interesting to see too whether you know they get some of the older instances as well so you know they just say the t2s aren't there and they're starting at t3s so where you know Sydney has you know some of your old instances your r4s and and the like and it's like that that you know maybe they'll never come to to Melbourne and so you know well it's it's sort of a quarter of what Sydney has you know it may be that we'll we'll get close but not to the same amount because they'll you know sort of drop all those obsolete instances or the the types that they wanted people to move off my guess from playing around with some of the regions which have been introduced before Melbourne is some of those instance types we will never see because I've done some things with multi-region before and it is quite interesting to go through and actually see in every region um particularly those free tier instances in every region are very subtly different depending on exactly what got deployed when so certainly in some of the newer regions um the teachers are not there and have not come have never come for Regions which have been around for quite some time the other thing that I think will be really interesting there is if people do decide to take that multi-region path uh how how many companies are still running on these obsolete instance types and are now going to decide that they have to re-architect everything just in order to use multi-region thanks yep probably but yeah I suspect you've got a good point there done there's gonna be a lot of those yeah okay so because yeah there were some big shifts in architecture at some point and that requires a whole bunch of updates but then yeah it's probably a good thing anyway if people start upgrading the instances because I mean having also recently looked at recently as in earlier today looked at a comparison chart of different types of ec2 instances for the purposes of deploying some new for the purposes of basically deploying an entirely new setup for something the price differences when using the newer generation instances are incredibly noticeable like looking at um I was looking at both the memory optimized instances and the compute optimized instances and if you look at basically the m6s and c6s the M5 and c5s are not even competitive and anything older than M5 there's just absolutely no point whatsoever so it will be really interesting to see and I'm suspecting um Matt said Banks I'm suspecting it's actually going to be anyone who has a requirement for low latency and anyone who has a requirement for that uh multi-region backup and a lot of the companies that fall into the latter group will already will already be doing this but they'll potentially be doing something like that multi-cloud so you you solve that yourself or you do the thing that you do the thing that gives the sort of job security and you hire a consultant to solve it those sorts of scenarios you potentially massively cut your complexity by moving everything to Melbourne and you might get the instance upgrade you know you might kind of have to talk to your instance type upgrade yeah into the bargain right so massively massively reduce your complexity and potentially actually reduce operating costs because the two operating costs that you then lose if you're currently operating multi-cloud are the operating cost of okay we're using really old instances if you are but also the operating cost of hey wait a minute we suddenly don't have these massive data egress costs and data Ingress costs to get everything from One Cloud to another yeah I think there will still be some requirements for the multi-cloud but I'm all in favor of just using that as a data backup Source or Target um but yeah with the new instance type style but I was really surprised by how little graviton instances there are in the new region so for easy to there's a couple options m6s originally only the ones with the native SSD the big ssds included but now also just regular m60s and that's the only graviton source I saw you can't use them in RDS you can't use them in Lambda can't use them anywhere really and considering how much I have been feeling that it was just pushing us to use them that really surprised me yeah it all it almost feels like and look we've seen this when I release new Services it's it's the MVP um almost almost thinking of it as a quasi Canary um kind of release Here we will give the people the basics because let's face it you know a lot of the core Services you know your lambdas your dynamodb RDS ec2 S3 like there is enough there to build most common bits and pieces the one big killer on the the compute side is obviously a lack of kubernetes personally don't care I think my personal opinion on kubernetes is well documented at this point oh yes um but but it's it's like let let's give the people enough to be able to do things it may not be a hundred percent of what they want but it will be enough for art for AWS to bed down the services to validate the use the usage validate capacity planning and then you know start directing the where do we point the fire hose as far as what we build and release next um and that was only kind of sort of a pun um of a reference to a lack of um Kinesis but yeah yeah but interesting so that as well you know been there and pointing things out you know I think one good thing to to for will to remember is is it's missing a service that you really want you know talk t-ray the best reps let them know because you know the more things that people ask for you know as the heat map goes up they're more likely to roll those Services out that the you know most people are asking for so you know don't be don't who wants to take bets on how many pfrs are going to be raised in the next 30 days yeah I would not want to be an AWS SAE dealing an essay or a time dealing with any of the customers who are trying to move things into Melbourne right now because I imagine that the phones are probably ringing off the proverbial hook pretty much yeah because we all know that what everybody wants and so please make sure you file your request for work dogs um everybody well there's actually a funny little clock there because if you run a um and this is this is something that I've seen people do when they send out the links if you run your AWS accounts off AWS SSO and you use a custom URL you get that prefix dot awsapps.com start which will take you to your SSO sign-in portal but if you have just prefix.awsapps.com that takes you to the work docs portal so I'm actually mildly curious if you went in it whether it's going through one of those things I don't even I don't even know if SSO in Melbourne is active yet as I said on the pattern yeah I was figuring probably not as I said on the panel I have all of my stuff set up in error because it's a region which things come to fairly quickly but I'm curious what will happen if SSO gets to release before work docs because that url.awsapps.com actually goes if you omit the start at the end it actually goes to the work docs portal so I've seen multiple times people send out the short URL I wonder what would happen that that that's going to end up being a breaking bug for someone at some point yeah interesting yeah I suspect it will come around the same time so that they can work around that issue because I so hate hate hate that you need this let's start I have spent so many so much time telling people to put this list out behind it when they couldn't log in same it's just one of those weird quirks of how the uis are set up yeah it's just like just just bookmark the URL and click your bookmark don't type it in yeah well it's not that you can't type it in you just have to know what it is that you're putting into the console right yeah if you know what it is that you're putting in you end up being fine but there are a lot of people who don't and that's where you then run into issues yeah like everyone I'm sure everyone who works with awss so I refuse to call it IAM identities it's just on principle alone yeah yeah everyone who works with awssr has been caught by that at least once right yeah yes yes the service formerly known as yeah I still don't understand why they change why they changed the name of that it's the most baffling thing I actually don't mind the identity center part of it it's just that they had to put I am in front of it that's a bit of a shame yeah yeah yes maybe it was a Monday for full stroke that just went too far again I repeat ATM machine yeah okay so your PIN number yes honey how all of those examples come back to Banks isn't it uh yes that's um but it is you know for as as much as we're hanging on things you know they said it's that are you you know we are all super glad that it's here um you know now you know definitely now gives us options for um you know the in region you know region this time meaning in country uh confused type but yeah it gives us that in country sort of the uh you know extra region for those you know services that need to have um data residency you know I mean yeah um availability zones are are pretty safe but you know if you really risk adverse um you know having that separation between Sydney and Melbourne for your for your uh for your data that's that's a good thing risk averse you've got client you've got you know compliance requirement um this is this is huge um for a large number of Industries um and as as Dawn was sort of saying before look those those who have needed multi-region multi you know data center multi location um previously have done it through the use of multi-cloud or a hybrid on-prem solution or something and this gives you the option to you know centralize to standardize missing instances notwithstanding uh Missing service is notwithstanding so like it this is this is fantastic like this is going to keep a lot of people very very busy for um at least 2023 this is going to keep a loss of Consultants very very employed for at least two thousand well that too yeah yeah yeah considering we're all consultants in on this like on this podcast it's like we are all looking at very busy years I actually want to pick up on the data center uh comment that you just made there because that's quite interesting in that we sort of look at this as a lot of people will have done this a lot of people who have that compliance requirement will have done this basically multi-cloud but the other thing that we might see here is this might actually lead to quite a lot of places decommissioning their data so centers which they've been using for backup purposes and again obviously you know that's going to keep Consultants very employed for at least at least 12 months so that's nice but it's also going to be quite interesting to see then how that changes things like Data Center capacity uh around the Melbourne region and in the Melbourne I.T Community because just thinking about it and thinking about sort of the history of some of the big players that I know are still using some sort of data center in Melbourne I suspect a lot of those big players now that they potentially can are going to be in a very big rush to obsolete they're going to be in a very big rush basically to start turning things off well let's like let's let's be frank here like Colo pricing is horrendously expensive in Australia oh yeah especially in Melbourne and in Sydney yes and it's not just that you then also have to take into account all of the costs for maintaining that data center all of the costs for maintaining your configuration around it your setup and networking infrastructure Staffing absolutely and you've got to have I think that my understanding from talking to people who've worked in the on the data center side of things in the past is the cost of having people come in and maintain your data centers is hideously expensive here in Australia in general just because we don't have that many people who can do it you know yeah a lot of a lot of people who have the ability to do that have gone whatever money takes up right because it's a it's a niche skill set it's a niche skill set which is incredibly valued by places that have historically needed to maintain some sort of data center some sort of data center for whatever reason and a lot of the people who are good with that sort of thing have jumped to Cloud providers and they've jumped to others I cannot I cannot physically remember the last time I stepped inside a data center I used to live in them and it's probably it it would be safe to say I have probably not stepped inside a data center since probably six months after AWS launched in Sydney yeah I have the unique distinction I think I'm not sure if it's actually unique to people on this call because I don't know how much you've been in data centers I am but I have the distinction of never having set force in a data center at all because I'm in that age bracket and in that bracket of people who came into the IT industry Cloud first lucky you you make me feel all done but for those that are listening you know we we've got video tunes on here but you know you can see see the green in net speed and especially in mind you know I used to live in data centers uh you know my my family was sort of like you know aren't you cold and things of like I used to live in data centers and walk around in shorts and t-shirts um because I was just so used to walking outside onto Collins Street in the middle of summer in a Woolen jacket and going why am I sweating all oh right it's 40 degrees yeah you're the weird guy yeah to me Frank you would have always been the weird guy but yeah but you know you're definitely right you know you know a lot of the worked in in the data centers and and stuff you know there's there's not as many people around now that do that or do it well you know and a lot of us have all jumped jump to Cloud yeah because it became the self-fulfilling prophecy where everyone worked out that cloud was where the industry was headed and as people got out of the data center racket it suddenly became apparent that there there's just not enough people who can do it and and do it well anymore yeah and if you're doing that type of thing um you know you then got the hyperscalers that you know obviously you know on our side of the fence we code it all up and that but there's also that side that's definitely needs to maintain all of the infra that that we're happily uh coding up for and I bet those places are a lot more interesting to work for anyone that's he actually wants to touch metal then you know you're uh even your Enterprises as you know the the resident the resident person who tends to point out accessibility things is data center work is actually really hard work you have to be like I not only have I never set footing one I probably couldn't physically do it because you have to be quite fit um you have to be quite physically well too just to be able to meet the demands of okay I have to run around you know I have to run around data centers pull cables I have to be able to stretch I have to be able to bend so it's particularly if you're working on that the hardware side it is really hard work and Wrecking UPS yeah oh my God those things are heavy um there's a reason there at the bottom of the rack yeah exactly yeah and maintaining a local cyber Farm is completely different to doing anything in a data center at that scale and it's you know it's not easy work but there aren't that many people who can do it and it will be interesting to see because I do suspect that a lot of companies that have had that requirement are now going to be rushing to decommission it as quickly as they can so it'll be really interesting to see how that works out does it noticeably change the demand for data centers in Australia yeah it's it's a really interesting line of thought there for for that because I mean you know not only are you getting out but you know you've got different infrastructure to keep management of and you know keep your your cmdb certain documentation for how do we how do we practice physical stuff how do we config all this physical stuff different to our Cloud environments whereas now yeah ideally with your Dr it's just you know create another pipeline to this location and being away you go or you know or deploy it using the same pipeline depending on what sort of networking Tool uh infrastructure as code tools rather you're using yeah yeah or or even if you just you know want to go down to a really basic level if you're just using cloud formation templates and yeah manually just being able to go like here we go here's all the cloud formation templates I've got for this and just manually dump it into your other environment it's super easy to just spin it up especially I mean the um the services are available yeah that's going to be the sticking point well we're talking about moving out of the data centers if you're currently in a Data Center and you're going to move to AWS you're not used to all the 200 something Services anyway so then you basically go through the same thing that we've had the chance to go over eight years ago or whenever Sydney opened it didn't open with a lot the only difference is now that's by the time you get started the new services will keep coming in at a much faster that is a really good point like I remember a few and by that I probably mean like four or five five or six re invents ago I vaguely remember I might have been jassy it might have been Werner saying that like only five or ten percent of all workloads had moved to the cloud some really small number and what you're saying sort of is a really good reminder like we we live AWS like all day every day like we've been doing this for a long time now like you know we're sitting here complaining about the fact that we don't have the creme de la cram um in Melbourne but for most I.T people I would probably say you're probably right like what what is in Melbourne today is what you would probably start with you've got ec2 you've got RDS they're your cause you've got S3 for your object storage you've got Lambda to get started in the event space you've got event Bridge you've got dynamodb right so you've got your core bits and pieces there you've got step functions if you want to go a little bit more advanced and let's face it it's not until you get all of that under your belt that you're going to be looking for kinesis or security Hub or AWS backup or you know any of these more advanced services that you sort of go and now I want X and if AWS sort of take three months six months nine months to bring some of those things in maybe that's not necessarily A Bad Thing and for those of us who have been doing it the whole time well we're already well versed in not having service or feature parity cross region because let's face it we've never had features so feature or service parody across region and never will and I think the other interesting point that comes out of that is that you look at anyone who has the need for maybe not so much on the latency requirement but anyone who has the need for that redundancy requirement if you have that need you're not using Kinesis as part of your core workload most likely you're not using certainly if you're in Australia if you're in any of the areas where multi-region has been a thing for a while you probably are but you're not using you know you're not using Kinesis as as part of your workload um you're not using a sage maker uh you're not using a lot of these so a lot of these AWS custom rolled Services which are used for very specific use cases you're using ec2 you're using RDS you're using a Lambda you're using stack functions if you're in one of those highly regulated environments which has requirements around data backup data sovereignty you are not doing these things you are not using these Services it's just a simple fact that the reality of the situation is you are going to be using the core Services which are already in Melbourne now again whether you're using the correct instance types or whether you have all of the underlying support for the things that you want to do that's an entirely different matter but if you're you know if you're running these Mission critical workloads you're not using deep composer at any point in the workflow yeah yeah exactly I do want to point out one thing though if you're starting out in the Melbourne region fresh coming to AWS and you look at all the available surfaces do yourself a favor and ignore that simple workflow is there yeah what what is with that wait a minute simple workflow service made it into Melbourne yes you did it is really I want to know ah which Enterprise customer in Australia is using that because there there has to be a customer that demanded that that be there oh yeah that was absolutely a request to the times no actually I think it's on the list of this of services that launch in every new region ah there's a list on the infrastructure side and it's I'm pretty sure it's on there yeah maybe it's just it's like just a really simple thing that's you know service it's a simple thing um yeah maybe it's just like uh here we just throw this in because with everything else that we do we'll yeah it because it only uses ec2 and ec2 is going to be there anyway so therefore yeah we may as well push the button right yeah yeah maybe maybe secretly it's just an API to Amazon Mechanical Turk anyway I mean I that's the kind of thing you say that jokingly but I'm sure that there are some AWS services that have those Integrations snuck in I'm sure there are okay but um one thing that Don sort of um figured my well I'm talking about latency you know one of the the good things that we can do now that we've got this this region I was going to a ward the other day um and it you know the question came up about you know have you have you selected your you know your location based on you know uh latency and your requirements Etc you know and traditionally that has been uh you know ignore this question due to architectural you know yeah yeah we we've seen them because it's the only region um you know now we actually have a choice that question within the uh well architected reviews can't actually have a meaning yeah we pick Sydney because it's missing from Melbourne uh that is just going to be the reality for a while I suspect yeah it was something that I thought of and we had a little bit of a chuckle when we did that War uh and came across that question it's like yeah you know dig that off because it was at the time when it was launched there was no other option um yeah but um but yeah meow you know some of those little things I think we'll find going forward now like councils of that that war question on those things like why are we doing doing this well hey you know yeah we're doing it you're designing something when you're talking to a customer like it's a thing now like it's a discussion point that needs to be I think I'm gonna need to to individual a Jew because it's what 9 35 at night and I have a three week old that needs my attention um but I was what I I did just want to say one other thing it's like we're sort of joshing here about the fact that you know this is missing that's missing we missed it we wish this was here we wish that was here how we're gonna live with only 125 different instance types 118 118 sorry um two two bits wow like are we just like the whiny customers of like all time here like and secondly we now have the ability to do multi-region cross-state architectures and solutions having done nothing ourselves to accomplish that but sit here for two years going is it done yet is it done yet is it done yet why didn't you hit 2022 and that's kind of like one of the big things that a lot of people still may not necessarily remember is the clouds constantly evolving and expanding and like if we back like we were talking about Data Centers before if we wanted to put another region on ourselves that is a Monumental engineering effort like excluding the cost conversation just the raw effort and materials and infrastructure needed to bring up a new site and a different state is mind-boggling and the fact of the matter is it's still way harder to enable the Melbourne region in your AWS account than it should be that is perfectly legitimate gripe but it is way easier than doing it yourself yeah it's not just the engineering requirements it's the people requirements as well the number of people that you need to set up a data center then the amount of time and money that you need to sink into the HVAC systems that you need to sink into the cooling systems that you need to sink into redundancy backup power setting up Network links that's a lot of time that's a lot of money that's a lot of people that are required to set things up it's a lot of people that are required to maintain the HVAC system so I'm actually going to say the bad word that nobody expects here because one of the things that we saw when cryptocurrency and web free and all of this nonsense became a thing was how much people were paying for those overheads you know to set up their Bitcoin mining Farm well their ethereum mining somewhere there I I don't know their algorand mining Farm or some of these weird names that I've never heard yeah insert random crypto coin here yeah yeah insert random crypto crypto coin or web3 ecosystem or whatever they're calling it here but we saw how much strain the requirements for all of that overhead were putting on you know as you've got people setting up these crypto mining Farms all over the world that's been happening with traditional data centers for a very very long time and it's exactly the same requirements it's exactly the same overhead exactly the same people that you need so yes on one level we're sitting here complaining about this but this is it is also these are things which unless you are a big bank or a company that has a lot of money in the bank or a company that has massive amounts of venture capital funding you are not doing this yourself because it so okay yeah you have to go in and enable the Melbourne region that's five clicks the other thing which we haven't really talked about all that much which I do want to bring up related to that point is it's not just that we have the Melbourne region now we also have the powerful local Zone yeah and I will let you guys talk to talk to that on your own obituary thanks for being here Matt uh the scene was a puff local Zone that I sort of wanted to talk about here is it's not just now around that latency requirement obviously the subset of services that you can get in the perf local zone is quite limited but what that enables you to do is the latency difference between Sydney and Melbourne is you know maybe 50 milliseconds at maximum but having because Sydney and Melbourne geographically are quite close to each other having even The Limited subset of features in Perth means that if there are workloads that you really need to run at the edge on the western side of the country that is now a thing you can do yeah definitely definitely um you know that was that that was really good for you know those people because you know it is a long way away yeah and you know as limited as the local zones are um you know there's still a lot of core functionality that you can run out there and for those you know things that you know really latency is important yeah you can tip them out there um you know do more than you know what you could with uh an edge location you know that's even even more limited but um yeah you know you can actually run stuff close to close to you yeah and the Perth latency difference is really big so one of my birthday's colleagues he did a check and an instance in the Perth local Zone from his home and be in a connection he can reach in 15 milliseconds that's quite good whereas Sydney would be 58 milliseconds so that's a massive change yeah and for my expectation would be you know that's going to be vastly dependent on quality of your internet connection and things you might there are some scenarios where you might actually see improvements that are more like going from triple digits down to double digits some use cases and that being able to do that is that's really good and I'm interested to see I probably won't be in Australia by the time it happens but I'm interested to see when that becomes a fourth legis region because I suspect that in 10 years or so by the time that I am well out of the country that will be what we'll be looking at an AWS region in Perth at some point possibly yeah if it keeps growing um in a way the local zones are above to Growing because in that in that regard we've got another region coming up around us fairly soon like next year the Auckland region should launch but before that the Auckland locals on will arrive yeah I thought that was an interesting um sort of thing having a sort of like an interim local Zone uh you know just before the region comes up yeah it's it's a bit like the US Saka region but then sped up instead of staying at a limited region for 10 years I quite like it because it means that it all things it gives AWS the ability to gauge demand the other thing that it does is it means that people can get started it gives people the ability to play around to figure out what they are what they can do to understand how latency improvements how all of the things that you get when you move over to a region that's closer to you can benefit you and then it sort of gives AWS the chance to actually validate commercially is this a thing we want to do before again they sing massive amounts of money into configuring data centers and such so I I think it's an eminently sensible way of doing things because it also like it gives people the ability to get started and do something even if you can't run whatever workloads you want to on the full features that you can do something yeah I also thinking about like you know would it have made more sense to do you know Wellington local Zone and then apply to Auckland um but then you're thinking about that would be because the Auckland local Zone will be tied to to Sydney if they had Wellington local Zone and then an Auckland region you know would that Wellington local Zone they'd still be paid for Sydney that that could be a nice computer yeah that could be confusing so I suppose yeah I have the the Auckland local Zone and then once you deploy your read engine okay the local Zone goes away yeah probably makes more sense yeah um super interesting time to be working in to be working in AWS in Asia Pacific or in Oceania really yeah I just think you feel like it's going to be interesting to you know to also have a look at you know for Adelaide to people in South Australia to make the choice of where do they where do they connect to Melbourne or Sydney um you know have a look at you know what are your latency differences yeah you link from from memory having played around without myself in another cloud provider at one point um Melbourne is generally faster but not by much yeah you're talking single digit single digit milliseconds generally um and that that obviously depends on the quality of your networking quality of your data equipment it depends on the quality of them The Links of the data center are from memory Melbourne is generally very slightly faster so it probably come down to um you know which which which state does SA um hate belief do you have more of a grudge against Melbourne or Sydney um yeah or realistically it might be that because the latency difference is so small it's going to come down to one of two things that will be feature sets so is everything that we need available in milk is everything that we need actually deployed in Melbourne or availability like can we get the instance types that we want in the region that we want to deploy this to because that has been an issue in Sydney that for some instances and some service types the compute capacity is just not there yeah yeah definitely but yes there's just a little bit of a joke but uh but yeah you know still an interesting question for for if you're in Adelaide which is really the there's there's no I suppose really clear option between you know Melvin Sydney as you say like the lights is sort of negligible between the two um you know feature steps going to be a big one until you know Melbourne matures and gets most of the stuff that's there there's there's obviously that question there as opposed to like you know Perth now you know we'll have has the local zone so there's some value you know you most likely jump into to Sydney um you know really you'd probably still go to Sydney but they'll also go to local Zone exactly and that local Zone will be tied to sending so yeah you know there are you know you've got some that are obvious which region do we do we go to um the chair I just yeah I'm thinking Perth oh sorry South Australia is that interesting one where it's you know toss a coin yeah yeah so yeah and it's going to depend on exactly I mean the the ultimate Frozen the IT industry right it depends it's going to depend on exactly what you want to do exactly how you want to do it and yeah maybe which city you hate the least yeah let's hope most choices are a little bit more pragmatic than that would be nice but people are people right and with that I believe we have gone on long enough we're happy we've got the new region definitely still still party poppers yes we are spoiled as much as we've complained about things that aren't there I think the overall feeling is Party Poppers yay um it's here yeah yeah and also we're not going to be out of a job Consultants it's going to be consultants in Australia are not going to be out of a job in the near future and depending on exactly what you're doing I'm suspecting that for a lot of Consulting companies the phone's going to be ringing off the hook about now cool so with that I want to thank everybody for listening of course I also want to thank our sponsors CMD Solutions the user group of school sponsor as well as ferson and C4 who are silver sponsors again this year all three of them then of course Matt has already left us so thank him again he's quiet so don thank you for coming thank you for having me as per usual it's always a pleasure and Jason thank you as well thank you Ian um always fun to to be on here and chatting with Matt the one as well and uh thank you for hosting and of course if you want to reach out to the user group um give feedback on our talk disagree with us in any way you want you're welcome to do so you can find us on social media we are on LinkedIn these days as well active Edwards use the group and then Melbourne in Brackets you can also find us on Mastodon as AWS melb at edwardscommunity.social and if you're actually still using Twitter we're still there not active but we're still there as at AWS melb and of course join the slack which you can find on our website at melb.ad AWS ug.org and with that I beat you all a good day good night good day good night good time zone appropriate Gracie
